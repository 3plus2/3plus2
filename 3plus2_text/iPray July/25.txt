TITLE: Thursday 25th June 
GOSPEL: Mt 7:21-29
"Not every one who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven ... Every one then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house upon the rock; and the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat upon that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock." 
COMMENTS: Not everyone who prays ‘_Lord, Lord..._’, not everyone who does some good things will enter the kingdom of Heaven. You can do lots things, you can build a ten story building, but if you don’t do the Will of God... it has no foundation, and it collapses. Some may think that Christian life is about accumulating prayers: if you pray ten hail Maries instead of one, they think, you are ten times holier. But it’s not so.
If you pray the rosary during your maths lesson, you are praying, but not doing what God wants you to do (pay attention and offer your lesson). Holiness is about doing what we ought to do; that is the Will of God and the foundation of the building of your holiness. When it’s time to pray we pray; when it’s time to study, we study; when it’s time to sleep... we sleep.
Have you ever read the story of Sisyphus? In Greek mythology Sisyphus was a king of Ephyra. He was punished for chronic deceitfulness by being compelled to roll an immense boulder up a hill, only to watch it roll back down, repeating this action forever. Some may think that Christian life is like that: just do good things as Sisyphus rolls the boulder. But like a building without foundation, and the boulder of Sisyphus, all you do comes to nothing if you don’t try to do always the Will of God: what you ought to do. 
“_Do you really want to be a saint? Carry out the little duty of each moment: do what you ought and concentrate on what you are doing_” (St. Josemaría).
