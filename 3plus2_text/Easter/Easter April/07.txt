TITLE: Tuesday 7th April (Easter Tuesday)
GOSPEL:Jn 20:11-18 
But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb ... she turned round and saw Jesus standing, but she did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping? Whom do you seek?" Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, "Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away." Jesus said to her, "Mary." She turned and said to him in Hebrew, "Rab-boni!" (which means Teacher). Jesus said to her, "Do not hold me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brethren and say to them, I am ascending to my Father and your Father." 
COMMENTS: Mary loved Jesus but something prevented her recognising Him. When she heard her name, with that Voice, that tone! We can imagine how she shuddered at the hearing of it. That name she had heard so many times in the lips of Jesus: ”_Mary!_”
There are many ways to pronounce a name. Think about the many people that have said your name, always differently: your parents, siblings, friends... you could recognize each one of them on the phone just by hearing them saying your name. But even the same person, i.e. your mother: you can tell what’s coming just by listening to her saying your name in the distance... 
Jesus didn’t need to say anything else to Mary; just her name. Jesus called everyone by their name. All of them remembered well how Jesus pronounced their names: Peter, John, Andrew, James, Nicodemus, Joseph... and to Our Lady: “_Mother_”, and to Joseph: “_father_”. And to you... Can you imagine how your name would sound with the voice of Jesus? - because He uses it every day to talk to you in your prayer.
“_Just like our mother, he calls us by our name, by the name we're fondly called at home, by our nickname. There, in the depths of our soul, he calls us and we just have to answer: Ecce ego quia vocasti me — here I am, for you have called me_” (St Josemaría).
