TITLE: Thursday 16th April 
GOSPEL: Jn 3:31-36 
John the Baptist said to his disciples: "He who comes from above is above all; he who is of the earth belongs to the earth, and of the earth he speaks; he who comes from heaven is above all. He bears witness to what he has seen and heard, yet no one receives his testimony; he who receives his testimony sets his seal to this, that God is true."
COMMENTS: Some people only seem able to view things negatively. One such cynic, watching his friend trying to start his motorbike, commented: “_That engine will never start_.” Immediately the engine made a big noise and started. Not wishing to be proven wrong, he held his ground: “_Anyway... It’ll probably never stop.” He belonged to the earth. 
He who is “_of the earth belongs to the earth, and of the earth he speaks_”; he only knows how to speak calamities, complaints, criticism and sarcasm. But we belong to Heaven, don’t we? We were made for happiness, for love, for paradise. And we must bear witness to it. That’s what a Christian should be. Where a Christian is walking by, Jesus is passing by with him. 
Our conversation should reflect our supernatural faith, which will bring others to the realisation that there is more to life than meets the eye; there is a God who loves us so much that He made the world as the anteroom of Heaven. Real Christians overflow with joy.
“_How I wish your bearing and conversation were such that, on seeing or hearing you, people would say: This man reads the life of Jesus Christ_” (St Josemaría). What can people say of my conversation?
