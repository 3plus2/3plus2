TITLE: Saturday 18th April 
GOSPEL: Jn 6:16-21 
It was now dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them. The sea rose because a strong wind was blowing. When they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near to the boat. They were frightened, but he said to them, "It is I; do not be afraid." 

COMMENTS: TThey are suffering in the middle of the storm and God comes to help. We don’t know what kind of assistance they were expecting, but certainly not Jesus walking on the waters! They thought it was a ghost. 
When the people or Israel were slaves of the Egyptians God sent Moses to release them. But the pharaoh didn’t like it, so he demanded more work from them; and they went to complain to Moses: “_you have made us offensive in the sight of Pharaoh_”. You see?: They called on God to be released and when God sends help they complained. So often men ask God for help and then don’t like ‘_that sort of help_’ He is offering.
There was a flood in a village. A man was trapped on the roof of his house surrounded by water. A man came to rescue him with a canoe, but he replied: —_Oh! Don’t bother: God will come and rescue me_. Minutes later another man came in a boat, and few minutes afterwards even a helicopter came, but he gave the same answer: —_Don’t bother: God will come and rescue me_. He eventually drowned and met St Peter and complained: ‘_Why did heaven abandon me?_’ And St Peter answered: —_What!? We sent you a canoe, a boat and a helicopter!_
When God comes, He makes His own conditions, and we need to learn to recognize Him; especially when He comes in the shape of Bread!
