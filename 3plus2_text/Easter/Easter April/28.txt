GOSPEL: Jn 10:22-30
The Jews gathered round him and said to him, "How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly." Jesus answered them, "I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness to me; but you do not believe, because you do not belong to my sheep." 


COMMENTS: The problem wasn’t that Jesus didn’t speak plainly enough. The problem was that they didn’t want to listen. Some people ask Jesus questions but don’t listen to answers. They may say: ‘_If God wants me to do this or that... He can tell me plainly!_’ He does; but you don’t get it because you are not ready to listen.
Winter, 1917. A 15 year old boy is walking through the little town of Logroño (Spain), early in the morning. He stares at the spectacle of the snow-covered town. Then something catches his attention that will change his entire existence: some footprints in the snow. He examines them and follows their trail until he catches up with the Carmelite friar whose bare feet had made them. He is dumbfounded: there are people in the world, like this man, who make great sacrifices for God and for others. ‘_What about me? Am I not going to be able to offer him anything?_’ That was the beginning of his vocation. Young Josemaría - that was his name - became a priest, and a saint.
How many other people saw those same footprints? Did they react as Josemaría did? He was ready to listen to the voice of God, not with words, but with deeds. 
Lord, Jesus, if You want to say something important to me, please help me to listen, and follow You.
