TITLE: Thursday 23rd April. St George
GOSPEL: Jn 15:18-21
"If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you. If you were of the world, the world would love its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you. Remember the word that I said to you, 'A servant is not greater than his master.' If they persecuted me, they will persecute you; if they kept my word, they will keep yours also. But all this they will do to you on my account, because they do not know him who sent me. 

COMMENTS: One day Blessed Pius IX had a meeting with seminarians. They were all studying theology and the Pope wanted to check how much they knew. He approached one of the students and asked him: —_What are the marks of the Church?_ The young fellow answered quickly: —_She is One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic_. Bl Pius smiled and said: —_There is another one_. The boy looked at him puzzled, and the Pope went on: —‘Persecuted’. The Church will always be One, Holy, Catholic, Apostolic and Persecuted, or she will stop being the Church of Jesus Christ; do you remember?: “If they persecuted me, they will persecute you”_.
Jesus was persecuted and killed; the Apostles followed Him and were persecuted as well; millions of Christians have given their lives in persecutions during 20 centuries. And even today Christians are persecuted, imprisoned and killed in many places [think about Syria, Egypt, Libya, Pakistan, China, Nigeria, North Korea, Iraq...]. Jesus said that it was going to happen; but He also said: “_I will be with you every single day until the end_”  
May all persecuted Christians feel my prayers for them today. St George, martyr of the faith, pray for them!
