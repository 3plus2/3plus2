TITLE: Monday 6th April (Easter Monday) 
GOSPEL: Mt 28:8-15 
So the women departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples. And behold, Jesus met them and said, "Hail!" And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshipped him. Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid; go and tell my brethren to go to Galilee, and there they will see me."  
COMMENTS: They say that the sentence: “_Don’t be afraid!_” can be found in the Bible more than 300 times. Good teachers always repeat the message that they want to get across! And You, Lord, every time You show Yourself to your disciples, or You let them know Your Will for them, You said: “_Don’t be afraid!_” But what could Mary of Magdala be afraid of now?! I think she had one single fear: the fear of losing her Master again. 
Children of God should never be afraid, whatever happens. The disciples were afraid because they had lost Jesus on Good Friday. Their hopes were over; their discouragement stopped them moving forward: fear paralyzes Christians when they don’t see Jesus.
My God, may I never be afraid of anything, except losing You, by sin. And if that happens again - for I know very well how weak I am - I beg You to come and search me out as You did search these holy women, and Your frightened Apostles. O my Jesus, if ever I start feeling afraid or unsettled, if ever You see me in distress, come and let me hear Your voice again as you remind me: “_Don’t be afraid_”. 
My Mother, bring those words to my remembrance when I most need them. “_I plead with you-never, ever give up on hope, never doubt, never tire, and never become discouraged. Don’t be afraid ... Don’t be afraid to become the saints of the new millennium!_” (St John Paul II).
“_Today I say to you, dear young people: Do not be afraid of Christ! He takes nothing away, and he gives you everything_” (Benedict XVI).
