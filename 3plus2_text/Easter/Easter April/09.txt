TITLE: Thursday 9th April. Easter Thursday 
GOSPEL: Lk 24:35-48
As they were saying this, Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them, "Peace to you." ... And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. ... Then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures, and said to them, "Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead, and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things. 
COMMENTS:
 First He showed His Wounds; through those Wounds our sins can be forgiven. But those Wounds can’t heal the wounds of your sins if there is no repentance; that is why “_repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in his name to all nations_”. That mission was entrusted to His disciples and it’s something that _should be done_. 
You and I have that mission now, to remind everyone, no matter what sins they have committed, that through His Sacrifice, Jesus can forgive any sin in Confession; there the Wounds of Jesus erase forever the sins that we confess with contrition: A boy went to confess: ‘_Father, forgive me for I have stolen £7 to buy chocolates... but for the penance put £10_.’ —‘_What do you mean?_’ asked the priest puzzled, ‘_did you take 7 or 10?_’. ‘_It was £7, father_’ answers the boy, ‘_but I need £3 more!_’ Obviously he wasn’t very sorry for his sin. If there is no contrition, there is no forgiveness.
“_Confession heals, confession justifies, confession grants pardon of sin, all hope consists in confession; in confession there is a chance for mercy_” (St. Isidore of Seville).
