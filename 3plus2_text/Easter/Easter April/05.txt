TITLE: Sunday 5th April. Resurrection of the Lord
GOSPEL: Jn 20:1-9 
Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb. So she ran, and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, "They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him." Peter then came out with the other disciple, and they went toward the tomb. They both ran, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first; and stooping to look in, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in. Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb; he saw the linen cloths lying, and the napkin, which had been on his head, not lying with the linen cloths but rolled up in a place by itself. Then the other disciple, who reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed. 
COMMENTS: Apparently everyone is rushing around today, from the tomb to Jerusalem and back. After the three saddest days of their lives, His disciples are now all over the place. Could it be possible? Jesus is alive! The tomb is empty!
According to Christian tradition, while everyone else was scurrying around, Our Lady waited expectantly in prayer. During those three days Our Lady had been counting the hours until she could see Jesus alive. And so she was the first to see the risen Body of her Son, to kiss His pierced hands, to caress His open Side, to rest her head on the Sacred Shoulders on which the Cross rested, and to embrace the Glorious Body of her Son and converse with Him... forever. 
Let us be with Mary today, and we will see Our Risen Lord.
