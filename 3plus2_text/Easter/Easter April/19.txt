TITLE: Sunday 19th April 
GOSPEL: Lk 24:35-48
Jesus said to them, "These are my words which I spoke to you, while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled." Then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures, and said to them, "Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead, and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things."
COMMENTS: They hadn't understood the Words of Our Lord, you see? So much time spent with Him, so many conversations with Him, so many things Jesus had explained to them... But they still hadn't got it. But now, after His death and Resurrection He "_opened their minds_" and then they can see everything. Those days after His Resurrection were spent '_opening minds_'. 
How many times you and I have read Gospel texts, or listened to them at Mass, or in our prayer, and yet... we don't get their meaning. Then, one day, reading the same text of the Gospel again, you get the sense of something you had read many times but never understood before. That's how Jesus opens your mind if you give Him the chance. And that is also why we should read the Gospel every day and pray with it as we do now.
Resolution: Jesus, I want to read Your Gospel every day, and before I start reading Your Word, I will ask You to _open my mind_ and make me discover the meaning of Your Words for me today... ‘so that I may become a ‘_witness_’ of Your Word.
