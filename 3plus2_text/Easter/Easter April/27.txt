GOSPEL: Jn 10:1-10
Jesus again said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. All who came before me are thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not heed them. I am the door; if any one enters by me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture. The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I came that they may have life, and have it abundantly. 
COMMENTS: Jesus was warning His disciples that not everything that sounded like the voice of God was actually the ‘Voice of God’. In that time there were many religious leaders, many rabbis; some people would follow them, at least for a while. But with time, they proved not to be ‘true shepherds. They had people following them, but they were not following God, so they didn’t help people to follow ‘_the_’ Good Shepherd.
The great success of those rabbis was to have ‘followers’, even if they went nowhere. It’s a bit like us being obsessed with getting ‘_followers_’ in _Twitter_ or ¬_Facebook_ but we don’t really go anywhere, so they don’t follow. 
You, Lord, are the real Door; and that door is always open for us: for everyone. It cost You all Your Blood to open that door. If we cross it we can enter into intimacy with the Most Blessed Trinity. And yet, some people may pass in front of the door and not get in; for that reason we feel the need to push those in with our apostolate, evangelizing. Not forcing them, for they are free; but showing them the open door so that they can understand that they can always become intimate with God: Always! Besides, Our Lady is by the gate, holding the door open and calling us.
