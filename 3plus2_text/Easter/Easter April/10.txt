TITLE: Friday 10th April
. Easter Friday 
GOSPEL: Jn 21:1-14 
Simon Peter said to them, "I am going fishing." They said to him, "We will go with you." They went out and got into the boat; but that night they caught nothing. Just as day was breaking, Jesus stood on the beach; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to them, "Children, have you any fish?" They answered him, "No." He said to them, "Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some." So they cast it, and now they were not able to haul it in, for the quantity of fish. That disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It is the Lord!" 

COMMENTS:There were at least 7 disciples of Jesus on the boat. But only one recognizes Him in the distance: _the Beloved one_. I can imagine St John frowning and looking at the Man in the shore when he heard those words: "_Cast the net on the right side of the boat_”, thinking: ‘I have heard that phrase before. That voice reminds me of...’ Then he saw the amount of fish, and the penny dropped. He smiled first, and laughed afterwards, as someone who has been tricked for a while, and full of joy, as a madman-madly in love-he shouted: "_It is the Lord!_"
And I keep my eyes today on that teenager, his look clean, his heart in love, his virginal purity allowed him to recognize Jesus in the distance. Sins blind men, and purity gives light.
“_How I would like — you told me — the young apostle, John, would take me into his confidence and give me advice: and encourage me to acquire purity of heart. If you really would like it, tell him so: and you will feel encouraged, and you will receive advice_” (St Josemaría).
