TITLE: Friday 17th April 
GOSPEL: Jn 6:1-15
Seeing that a multitude was coming to him, Jesus said to Philip, "How are we to buy bread, so that these people may eat?" This he said to test him, for he himself knew what he would do. Philip answered him, "Two hundred denarii would not buy enough bread for each of them to get a little." One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to him, "There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two fish; but what are they among so many?" 

COMMENTS: You remember what happened next, don’t you? Isn’t it surprising that Jesus asks for help when He can do everything? He transformed water in wine, remember? If He can multiply bread, He surely can transform a few stones in bread and then multiply them... He can change a stone into a thousand fish. He can do anything, can’t He? So why does He ask for help? 
Because He wants to need you and me. A mother can let a 3-year-old child to help her baking a cake: beating the eggs, for instance. She could do it herself, of course, in a minute, but she is teaching, and having a great time with her child. And she loves it when dad comes and the little one says: ‘_we made your favourite cake!_’ Dad knows that the child has done very little, but he likes the cake all the more for it.
God wants your help; He wants you to become His instrument to feed many with His words; He wants to count on us to distribute what He wants others to receive. To be exact: He doesn’t need us; but He wants our help. What we do is always little, but if we do it, then He multiplies it: ‘the result of the generosity of men mixed with the generosity of God is infinite!’
