TITLE: Friday 17th April
GOSPEL: Jn 6:1-15
Seeing that a multitude was coming to him, Jesus said to Philip, "How are we to buy bread, so that these people may eat?" This he said to test him, for he himself knew what he would do. Philip answered him, "Two hundred denarii would not buy enough bread for each of them to get a little." One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to him, "There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two fish; but what are they among so many?" 

COMMENTS: You remember what happened next, don’t you? Isn’t it surprising that Jesus asks for help when He can do everything? He transformed water in wine, remember? If He can multiply bread, He surely can transform a few stones into bread and then multiply them... He can change a stone into a thousand fish. He can do anything, can’t He? So why does He ask for help? Why did He asked those men in Cana to pour water into the jars? If He can transform water into wine, surely He can transform air into water, and then water into wine... He can do it by Himself.
But He wants to need you and me. It is like a mother who lets a 3-year-old child help her baking a cake: beating the eggs, for instance. She could do it herself, of course, (probably quicker and better), but she is teaching and having a great time with her child. And she loves it when dad comes and the little one says: ‘_we made your favourite cake!_’ Dad surely knows that the child has done very little, but he likes the cake all the more for it.
It is always little what I can give, my meagre ‘_five barley loaves and two fish_’; but if I give it to You, then You can multiply it; and then, _the result of my generosity mixed with the generosity of God is infinite!_ Still some may think: “_but what are they among so many?_”. O yes, only “_five loaves and two fish_”... but more than 5,000 men were grateful to that boy for being generous and giving all he had.
Wouldn’t you like to be remembered as that generous boy?
