TITLE: Tuesday 14th April 

GOSPEL: Jn 3:7b-15 
Jesus said to Nicodemus: 'You must be born anew.' ... Nicodemus said to him, "How can this be?" Jesus answered him, "Are you a teacher of Israel, and yet you do not understand this? Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know, and bear witness to what we have seen ... No one has ascended into heaven but he who descended from heaven, the Son of man. And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up, that whoever believes in him may have eternal life."
COMMENTS: Nicodemus - a doctor of the Law and learned in the Sacred Scriptures - comes at night to ask a few questions to Jesus. But it doesn’t seem as if he understands a word. 
You, my Jesus, are the only one Who can reveal the truths that we need to believe. But You can’t get across all these things in just one conversation! Nicodemus probably met and talked with You on many more, because eventually, when all the others left You during Your agony and death, he was there to stand up for You. 
That is the effect of regular and frequent prayer. It’s like eating healthily: you don’t notice striking changes after one meal, or one week; but after a time you can tell something has changed, even though you don’t remember your meals. Only over time do we come to see its good. Likewise, to pray every day can be demanding, but only by that daily contact with Jesus can He get across what you need to believe, and transform you into another Nicodemus: faithful when others desert Him!
