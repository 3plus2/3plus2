TITLE: Wednesday 15th April 
GOSPEL: Jn 3:16-21 
For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God sent the Son into the world, not to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through him. ... This is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. 

COMMENTS: _For God so loved the world_... did you get that!? God loves the world. He always did and always will, for He is its Craftsman. Some people think that the world is bad and takes us away from God. But the world is a gift of God to us! Genesis states clearly that “_God saw everything that he had made, and indeed, it was very good_”. If He Himself said that _it’s good¬_, who am I to disagree?
Men have sometimes hidden the beauty of the Universe with their sins, but that doesn’t change it. You can crumple a £20 note or step on it with your dirty shoes, but it doesn’t lose a penny of its value. Every artist leaves some trace of himself in his work. Experts can recognize an artist’s work without looking at the signature. Have you ever find yourself astounded looking at the beautiful sunrise, a sunset in fire, a rainbow, the waves caressing the seashore, your reflexion on the surface of a lake, a thin crescent moon hung in a crystal-clear sky...? God made it for you. As a Good Father He loves to see that you love His gifts to you. As good and grateful children take great care of it. 
God loves the world so much that he gave his only Son, to be part of it; and He gave it to me as a stage for my happiness: I love passionately our world as well. _Thank you, Lord_.
