TITLE: Saturday 11th April (Easter Saturday)
 
GOSPEL: Mk 16:9-15 
Now when he rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene ... they would not believe it. After this he appeared in another form to two of them, as they were walking into the country ... but they did not believe them. Afterward he appeared to the eleven themselves as they sat at table; and he upbraided them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who saw him after he had risen. And he said to them, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to the whole creation”. 


COMMENTS: First there is a reproach; then there is a command. The reproach is that they didn’t believe those whom Jesus sent to them. Then there is a command - going to preach the Gospel to the whole creation. First we need faith, and then we can bring that faith to others; and this is what Jesus has commanded you to do too. 
The French Cardinal Roger Etchegaray once told the following story: During His Ascension, Jesus gazed down on earth and saw it in darkness, except for a few tiny lights in Jerusalem. On His way to Heaven He met the Angel Gabriel, who was accustomed to undertake earthly missions. The Angel asked Him: “_What are those little lights?_” “_They are the apostles that surround my Mother_,” Jesus answered him. “_This is my plan: once I return to Heaven, I will send them the Holy Spirit so that these small lights can turn into a great bonfire that will ignite the world with charity._” The Angel dared to ask: “_And if this plan does not work?_” After a moment of silence, Jesus answered: “_I do not have other plans!_” 
God has no other plans! We are the Apostles now. What a great responsibility! How many souls may depend on whether you and I become real apostles! What we don’t do... remains undone!
My Mother, Queen of the Apostles, pray for me that I won’t let so many souls down.
