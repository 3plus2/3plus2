TITLE: Thursday 30th April 
GOSPEL: Jn 13:16-20
After he had washed the feet of his disciples, Jesus said to them: "Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master; nor is he who is sent greater than he who sent him. If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them. I am not speaking of you all; I know whom I have chosen; it is that the scripture may be fulfilled." 

COMMENTS: _”I know whom I have chosen”_. You, Lord, know those you had chosen. You knew them better than they knew themselves. You taught them and gave them example, and they learned from You, the Master. And it reassures me to remember that You know me as well, and You know what You made me for.
You, Lord, are like a film director who is trying to find the perfect actor for a perfect role in a particular plot. Film directors have to go through catalogues of actors until they find someone who fits the description of the character they need. In the end they find someone who _may be_, more or less, _suitable_ for the job, [even] though he is rarely perfect.
The difference between the film director looking for actors and You, Lord, is that You don’t look for them: ‘You make them!’ And therefore, You make each one perfect for the role that they have to do: ‘You know whom You have chosen’ and ‘what You have chosen them for’. 
I too am made perfect for my role, my mission in life; and I beg You, Lord, for the grace I need to fulfil it. I want to do with my life exactly what You think is best, for You know me better than I know myself. You know what I can do, Lord. 
What do You want me to do?
