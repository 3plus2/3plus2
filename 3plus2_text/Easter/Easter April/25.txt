TITLE: Saturday 25th April. St Mark 
GOSPEL: Mk 16:15-20
And he said to them, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to the whole creation" ... And they went forth and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by the signs that attended it. 
COMMENTS: How many people have left everything to devote their lives to preaching the Gospel! One of them is St Mark, whose feast we celebrate today. Tradition suggests that the Upper Room was in the house of his parents, so he was a Christian from childhood. Mark went with Paul and his cousin Barnabas on their first apostolic journey, but on arriving in Cyprus he left them and went back home. Paul was so upset that, later on, when Barnabas and he were planning their second journey, Paul would not hear of Barnabas bringing his cousin Mark with them again. They argued and eventually went their separate ways.
About ten years later we find Mark in Rome, this time helping Peter as interpreter, and writing his Gospel. In Rome he met Paul again and started serving him also. So the man who Paul didn’t want to be with on his second missionary journey, later became a “_faithful companion_” and a “_comfort_” (Col 4:10-11) to him in Rome. Around the year 66, shortly before his death, the Apostle writes to Timothy: _Get Mark and bring him with you; for he_ @is very useful in serving me@ (2 Tim 4:11).
All had been forgotten in the end. Mark had fled in the past, was weak, but he came back. It’s never late! “_It is a great example of how we should never write people off, and a wonderful lesson, should we ever need one, on how to reconstruct a friendship that appears to have been ruined forever!_” (Fernandez Carvajal).
