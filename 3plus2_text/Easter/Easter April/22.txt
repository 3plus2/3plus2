TITLE: Wednesday 22nd April
GOSPEL: Jn 6:35-40
Jesus said to them, "All that the Father gives me will come to me; and him who comes to me I will not cast out. For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me; and this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but raise it up at the last day. For this is the will of my Father, that every one who sees the Son and believes in him should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day." 
COMMENTS: The Father has entrusted Jesus with a mission: that He _should lose nothing of all that the Father has given Him_. Not a single person. All are destined to rise with Him at the end. Jesus Himself says: “_him who comes to me I will not cast out_”; no one who comes to Him will be locked out. 
The problem is that they don’t come to You, Lord. You, the Good Shepherd, always goes in search of everyone, but some don’t want to be found; when they see You, they run away and don’t let You _’chase’_ them. They want to be saved, but not _badly_. They want to go to Heaven, but ‘_kind of_’, ‘_eventually_’, or ‘_more-or-less_’. They pray as St Augustine did when he was young, and he wanted to convert, but ‘_not yet_’. He was _fine_ being a sinner, and he knew he had to change. He explains how he would pray asking You, Lord for help to convert, but always added at the end of his prayer: “_but not yet!_”
My Jesus, I pray today for all those who find it difficult to come to You; who hide from You, those destined for Heaven, entrusted to You by the Father, that they may go in search of You and let You find them. And for me, give me the grace to tell those lazy souls about Your Love and bring them to You: 
“_Don't you long to shout to those young men and women all around you: Fools, leave those worldly things that shackle the heart and very often degrade it..., leave all that and come with us in search of Love?_” (St Josemaría).
