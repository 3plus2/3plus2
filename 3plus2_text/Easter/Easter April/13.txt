TITLE: Monday 13th April. St Martin I, Pope and Martyr 

GOSPEL: Jn 3:1-8
Jesus answered to Nicodemus, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God." Nicodemus said to him, "How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?" Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born anew.' The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know whence it comes or whither it goes; so it is with every one who is born of the Spirit." 
COMMENTS: The reference to the water and the spirit here becomes the official presentation of the Sacrament of Baptism. St John the Baptist declared, '_I baptize in water'_, and the Messiah will baptize '_in the Holy Spirit'_. Water then, is not enough now.
The season of Easter is a particular time to bring the Holy Spirit to the fore. The Risen Jesus is preparing everything to entrust His Church to the care of the Holy Spirit. And now, the Holy Spirit is at work. You don’t see Him, as you don’t see the wind, but you see his effects. St John XXIII said: “_The saints are the masterpieces of the Holy Spirit_.” Those who - through water - have been baptized, have the Holy Spirit at work inside. 
The Holy Spirit is the Guest of our soul, His temple, as St Paul tells us: what kind of a host am I? Do I talk to Him? Do I listen to Him? Easter is a perfect time to foster my friendship with the Holy Spirit, the Paraclete; to talk and to listen to Him.
