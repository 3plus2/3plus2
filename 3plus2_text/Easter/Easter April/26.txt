TITLE: Sunday 26th April
GOSPEL: Jn 10:11-18
"I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. He who is a hireling and not a shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf snatches them and scatters them. He flees because he is a hireling and cares nothing for the sheep. I am the good shepherd; I know my own and my own know me." 
COMMENTS:

 A group of boys went for an excursion to the forest. As they were having lunch on a little hill they saw a shepherd coming with his sheep. Out of curiosity the leader of the group took advantage of the opportunity to check what they had read in the Gospel. When the shepherd was close enough he asked him what he would do if a sheep were lost. The shepherd with total indifference said: “_Too bad for it!_”, and kept walking unconcerned. 
Well, he wasn’t a good shepherd; was he? at least not like the one Jesus described: He ‘_knows_’ His sheep, He follows them up, looks and cares for them if they are lost; He lays down His live for them. Jesus never gives up any of His sheep. 
We are His sheep, and the sheep also have to be responsible to help other sheep to remain with the shepherd. In some way we are also shepherds of our friends, and try to behave with them as Jesus has taught us. 
Richard the Lionheart was once caught in an ambush by Saracens during the Crusades, while hunting with some other knights. They fought bravely but were outnumbered; all the knights died except William de Pourcellet who, in order to save the king shouted: ‘_I’m the King_’. The enemy captured him and took him to the sultan Saladin. There they found out the trick. But Saladin was so taken by the loyalty of that man that he spared his life. Loyalty is a virtue of friends who never give up. Jesus has taught us to be as loyal with our friends as He is with us: Am I loyal to my friends giving them the best I have: my friendship with God?
