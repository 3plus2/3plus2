TITLE: Tuesday 5th May 
GOSPEL: Jn 14:27-31a 
Jesus said to his disciples: “Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid. You heard me say to you, 'I go away, and I will come to you.' If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I go to the Father.” 
COMMENTS: Jesus is preparing His disciples for his Ascension: He will go to Heaven, but they shouldn’t be troubled or afraid. Christians have no reason whatsoever to be anxious, because He didn’t leave us by ourselves, the Holy Spirit, the Paraclete is in charge now. 
One day someone asked St John XXIII if he could sleep well with all the worries of the church. He explained that he had problems at the beginning, until one night he told himself: “_John, why don’t you sleep? Is it not the Holy Spirit who governs the church? Well then, what are you worried about? Go to sleep John!_” Since then, he said, ‘_he could sleep like a log_’. 
God wants us to be always at peace: interior peace (not be anxious about anything) and exterior peace (to be in peace with everyone). By the action of the Holy Spirit in us we are _sowers of peace and joy_. One of the features of saints is that when you are with them you feel in peace. They are ‘infecting’ with peace every atmosphere they are in.
Peace is a gift of the Holy Spirit we need to ask: ‘_See, my children, a person who is in a state of sin is always sad. Whatever he does, he is weary and disgusted with everything; while he who is at peace with God is always happy, always joyous_’ (St. John Mary Vianney).
