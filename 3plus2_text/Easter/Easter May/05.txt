TITLE: Tuesday 5th May
GOSPEL: Jn 14:27-31a 
Jesus said to his disciples: “Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid. You heard me say to you, 'I go away, and I will come to you.' If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I go to the Father.” 
COMMENTS: Jesus is preparing His disciples for his Ascension: He will go to Heaven, but they shouldn’t be troubled or afraid. Christians have no reason whatsoever to be anxious, because He didn’t leave us by ourselves. The Holy Spirit, the Paraclete, is in charge now. And when you work for God and with God, there is nothing that can shake your spirit. 
One day a journalist asked Pope St John XXIII if he could sleep well at night with all the worries and anxieties of having to lead the church. He explained that he had problems at the beginning, until one night he told himself: “_John, why don’t you sleep? Is it not the Holy Spirit who governs the church? Well then, what are you worried about? Go to sleep John!_” Since then, he said, ‘_I could sleep like a log_’. 
God wants us to be at peace always: interior peace (not being anxious about anything) and exterior peace (to be at peace with everyone). And that is one of the fruits of the Holy Spirit in our soul: we become _sowers of peace and joy_. That’s one of the common features of all saints: when you are with them you feel at peace. Their own peace ‘infects’ everyone around them. Our worries and anxieties have to be seen in perspective. When you have a speck of dust on your glasses you see it as a huge stain blinding your sight. But in reality it is a tiny speck.
Peace is a gift of the Holy Spirit we need to ask for: ‘_See, my children, a person who is in a state of sin is always sad. Whatever he does, he is weary and disgusted with everything; while he who is at peace with God is always happy, always joyous_’ (St. John Mary Vianney).
