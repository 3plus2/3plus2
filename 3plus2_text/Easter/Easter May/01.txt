TITLE: Friday 1st May. St Joseph the Worker
GOSPEL: Mt 13:54-58 
Coming to his own country he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, "Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works? Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary?"
COMMENTS: Has it ever happened to you that someone meets you for the first time and ask you: ‘_are you the son of..._’? And you answer proudly: ‘_Yes, he is my dad_’. I imagine that Jesus loved to be remembered as the son of Joseph. And I can imagine why: all the people of Nazareth knew Joseph, but all they can recall of him is that he was ‘the carpenter’. They didn’t remember Joseph by any extraordinary deed or ability; just by his daily task. And they remembered him because he was very good at it.
St Joseph is considered the greatest saint after Our Lady. Why? Because holiness is about love: who could love Jesus more than Mary and Joseph? But you don’t find miracles in the life of Joseph; no crowds of people coming to listen to his speech; no extraordinary things. We don’t even have a word spoken by Joseph in the Gospels - which says a lot about his humility and prayer life. He didn’t see the Angel, just heard him in dreams According to tradition, Joseph died before Jesus’ public life of miracles, preaching and crowds of followers.
All he saw was the saw, the chisel, the nails and the wood of his workshop, and the smiling face of Jesus and the comforting presence of Mary. Jesus, Mary and his work were enough to transform this humble carpenter into a great saint.
May I always work like him, in the presence of Jesus and Mary, proud to call St Joseph, ‘my father and lord’.
