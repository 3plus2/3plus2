TITLE: Friday 1st May (St Joseph the Worker)
GOSPEL: Mt 13:54-58 
Coming to his own country he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, "Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works? Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary?"
COMMENTS: Has it ever happened to you that someone meets you for the first time and asks you: ‘_are you the son of..._’? And you answer proudly: ‘_Yes, he is my dad_’. I imagine that Jesus loved to be remembered as the son of Joseph. And I can imagine why: all the people of Nazareth knew Joseph, but all they can recall of him is that he was ‘the carpenter’. There were, probably some other carpenters, but he was ‘the carpenter’ they all knew. They didn’t remember Joseph by any extraordinary deed or ability; just by his daily task. And they remembered him because he was very good at it.
St Joseph is considered the greatest saint after Our Lady. Why? Because holiness is about love, and who could love Jesus more than Mary and Joseph? But you don’t find miracles in the life of Joseph; you don’t see crowds of people coming to listen to his speech; you don’t find any extraordinary things other than having to run away to Egypt, to see his Child being born in a manger, or losing Him in the temple at the age of twelve. 
But we don’t even have a word spoken by Joseph in the Gospels - which says a lot about his humility and prayer life. He didn’t see the Angel, just heard him in dreams. According to tradition, Joseph died before Jesus’ public life of miracles, preaching and crowds of followers.
All he saw was the saw, the chisel, the nails and the wood of his workshop, and the smiling face of Jesus and the comforting presence of Mary. And Jesus, Mary and his work were enough to transform this humble carpenter into the great saint that we venerate.
St Joseph, my ‘father and lord’, teach me to be holy by the same means: Jesus, Mary and my work.
