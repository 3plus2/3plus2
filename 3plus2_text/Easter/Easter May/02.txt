TITLE: Saturday 2nd May (St Athanasius)
GOSPEL:Jn 14:7-14 
"If you had known me, you would have known my Father also; henceforth you know him and have seen him." Philip said to him, "Lord, show us the Father, and we shall be satisfied." Jesus said to him, "Have I been with you so long, and yet you do not know me, Philip?"
COMMENTS: Sounds like a kind reproach, doesn’t it? I have been with you all this time, “_and yet you do not know me_”. 
The Cure of Ars told the story of St Alexis, the only son of a rich Roman senator, who left everything to follow God and, in disguise, he travelled to the East and lived in great poverty. After many years, he became a famous holy man there - something he didn’t like at all-, so he ran away and ended up, one day, begging at his parents' home. His parents used to do great works of mercy for the poor, and assisted him as well, together with hundreds of other poor people; but they did not recognize him; they let him stay in a corner under the stairs, where Alexis lived for seventeen years, until he died. On the day he died, his own mother was taking care of his dead body when she recognised that it was her son who had lived for years under the stairs in her own palace. Tradition says that she exclaimed in tears: “_O my son! too late have I known thee!_” 
Commenting on the story, St John Mary Vianney said: “_The soul leaving this life will at last see Him, whom she possessed in the Eucharist so many times, and at the sight of the consolations, beauties and riches that she had ignored, she will likewise cry out: “O Jesus! O my Life! O my Treasure! O my Love! too late have I known Thee!_”
How do I try to recognize the God of my live in that piece of Bread at Mass? After so many Masses and communions and visits to the Blessed Sacrament, it would be sad to meet Our Lord at the end of our lives and hear Him say to me: "_Have I been with you so long, and yet you do not know me?_"
