TITLE: Saturday 2nd May. St Athanasius
GOSPEL:Jn 14:7-14 
If you had known me, you would have known my Father also; henceforth you know him and have seen him." Philip said to him, "Lord, show us the Father, and we shall be satisfied." Jesus said to him, "Have I been with you so long, and yet you do not know me, Philip?"
COMMENTS: Sounds like a kind reproach, doesn’t it? I have been with you all this time, “_and yet you do not know me_”. 
The Cure of Ars told the story of St Alexis, the only son of a rich Roman senator who left everything for God and, in disguise, he travelled to the East and lived in great poverty. One day, after seventeen years, he came as a beggar to his own home. His parents did not recognize him, but they were very kind to all poor people and so they let him stay in a corner under the stairs, where Alexis lived for seventeen years. His own mother was taking care of his corps when she recognised her son who had lived for years under the stairs in her palace. Then she exclaimed: “_O my son! too late have I known thee!_” 
Commenting the story, St John Vianney said: “_The soul leaving this life will see at last Him, whom she possessed in the Eucharist, and at the sight of the consolations, beauties and riches that she had ignored, she will likewise cry out: “O Jesus! O my Life! O my Treasure! O my Love! too late have I known Thee!_”
After so many Masses and communions and visits to the Blessed Sacrament, it would be sad to meet Our Lord at the end of our lives and listen to His Words: "_Have I been with you so long, and yet you do not know me, Philip?_"
