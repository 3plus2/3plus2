TITLE: Thursday 14th May (St Matthias)
GOSPEL: Jn 16:16-20 
"A little while, and you will see me no more; again a little while, and you will see me." Some of his disciples said to one another, "What is this that he says to us ... Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn into joy." 

COMMENTS: Sometimes we don’t see our Lord, but that is only for “_a while_”; moments in which we “_weep and lament_”. During these moments the enemies of God will rejoice, thinking that they have won; but not for long, because we have been promised by Him that we are on the winning side and God always fulfils His promises. 
It happens like in the history of Troy; do you remember? The city of Troy was protected by a wall, 20 feet high. The Greek warriors had been trying to breach the wall around Troy for about ten years. Finally, Odysseus, a Greek general, had an idea. They built a beautiful and huge wooden horse, and left it outside the gate. The Greek army pretended to leave, as if they had finally admitted defeat. But the horse was hollow and 30 men were hiding inside. The following morning the Trojans thought they had defeated the Greeks, and rushed outside cheering. They found the horse and dragged it inside the city as a ‘_trophy of victory_’. That night, while the Trojan people were sleeping, the men hiding inside the wooden horse climbed out and opened the gates. The waiting Greek army entered Troy. That was the end of Troy. 
Likewise, when the devil saw the dead Body of Our Lord hanging on the Cross he was convinced he had overcome Him, and thought that the Cross had become his ‘_trophy_’. Like the Trojan people, he was confident and at rest. But when the Tomb was opened on dawn of the third day, and the Risen Body of Jesus Christ shone living and radiant, he then saw his mistake; he understood he had been beaten on the Cross and defeated forever!
