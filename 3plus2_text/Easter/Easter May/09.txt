TITLE: Saturday 9th May 
GOSPEL: Jn 15:18-21
"If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you ... Remember the word that I said to you, 'A servant is not greater than his master.' If they persecuted me, they will persecute you; if they kept my word, they will keep yours also. But all this they will do to you on my account, because they do not know him who sent me."
COMMENTS:
 Those who hate Christians or Jesus Christ do that “_because they do not know him who sent me_”; they just don’t know! Do you remember the words of Jesus on the Cross? "_Father, forgive them; for they don’t know what they are doing_." Also St Stephen, as he was stoned, said a similar prayer.
And do you remember also the reaction of the centurion when Jesus died? He said: "_Truly this man was the Son of God!_" And one among the people stoning St Stephen to death of was Saul, who became St Paul. You see? a way to help people to find the truth is in giving example of Christian virtues. 
The 40 Martyrs of Sebaste were a group of Christian soldiers condemned in 320 to freeze to death in a frozen pond. They set a warm bath in front of the pond to tempt them to give up. One of them yielded leaving his companions. But then, one of the guards watching over the martyrs, seeing their example and faithfulness, at once proclaimed himself a Christian, threw off his garments, and joined the other martyrs to complete the number of 40.
The centurion, Saul, or the guard weren’t evil people: they were just ignorant. To convert they didn’t need any speech, just to see the example of Jesus (Master) and the saints (disciples).
