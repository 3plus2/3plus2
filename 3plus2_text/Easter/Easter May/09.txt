TITLE: Saturday 9th May
GOSPEL: Jn 15:18-21
"If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you ... Remember the word that I said to you, 'A servant is not greater than his master.' If they persecuted me, they will persecute you; if they kept my word, they will keep yours also. But all this they will do to you on my account, because they do not know him who sent me."
COMMENTS:
 Ignorance is the big enemy of God. Those who hate Christians or Jesus Christ do so “_because they do not know him who sent me_”; they just don’t know! Do you remember the words of Jesus on the Cross? "_Father, forgive them;_ @for they don’t know what they are doing@." St Stephen, too, as he was stoned, said a similar prayer.
And do you remember the reaction of the centurion when Jesus died? He said: "_Truly this man was the Son of God!_" And among the people stoning St Stephen to death was one Saul, who eventually became St Paul. Some people who don’t understand our faith may feel attracted by our ‘deeds’. They may tell you: ‘_Let me see what you believe_’ or: ‘_Do you love God? Show me!_’
The 40 Martyrs of Sebaste were a group of Christian soldiers condemned in 320AD to freeze to death in a frozen pond. They set a warm bath in front of the pond to tempt them to give up. One of them yielded leaving his companions. But at that, one of the guards watching over the martyrs, who had seen their example and faithfulness, proclaimed himself a Christian, threw off his garments, and joined the other martyrs to complete the number of 40.
The centurion, Saul, or the guard weren’t evil people: they were just ignorant. To convert they didn’t need any speech, just the example of Jesus (Master) and the saints (disciples).
“_There is a story of a soul who, on saying to our Lord in prayer, 'Jesus, I love you', heard this reply from heaven: 'Love means deeds, not sweet words'_” (St Josemaría).
