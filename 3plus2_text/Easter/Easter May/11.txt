TITLE: Monday 11th May
 
GOSPEL: Jn 15:26-16:4a 
But when the Counsellor comes, whom I shall send to you ... he will bear witness to me; and you also are witnesses, because you have been with me from the beginning. "I have said all this to you to keep you from falling away ... the hour is coming when whoever kills you will think he is offering service to God. And they will do this because they have not known the Father, nor me. But I have said these things to you, that when their hour comes you may remember that I told you of them. 


COMMENTS: The Holy Spirit, the Counsellor makes us witnesses of Jesus. We become witnesses because we have been ‘with Him’. We have to give witness to our Faith. That’s what ‘martyr’ means: witness. But don’t get it wrong: martyrs didn’t become saints because they ‘died’ for Jesus, but because they ‘lived’ for Jesus. Martyrs could give witness with their ‘deaths’ because they have given witness with their ‘lives’ before. They were ready ‘to die’ for Christ because they have ‘lived’ for Christ.
In many cases those who killed them thought they were “_offering service to God_”, as those who asked the crucifixion of Jesus, or those who stoned St Stephen... This shouldn’t take us by surprise, because Jesus warned us about it.
But you and I won’t probably be martyrs in that same sense. We will be ‘witnesses’ [martyrs] of Jesus Christ with our lives: when we get down to study in time, or we pray in time, or we do the dish-washer when it’s not my job, or we pay a visit to the Blessed Sacrament, or we speak without fear about our faith with our friends... That’s how you give witness to Jesus: that’s your martyrdom!
