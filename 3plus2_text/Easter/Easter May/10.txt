TITLE: Sunday 10th May
GOSPEL: Jn 15:9-17
"This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. You are my friends if you do what I command you ... You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide; so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you. This I command you, to love one another."
COMMENTS: I read the following reasoning: 1. You chose us to ‘give fruit’; 2. we become Your friends if we do ‘what You command’; 3. You command ”_to love one another_”; Conclusion: ‘Love’ is the fruit that You expect. That’s the example that You left to Your Apostles and Your disciples, and the example they have left to us. 
We have a mission: _to love one another_; and to love them as You love them; to love them with ‘deeds’, which are the fruits that endure. Acts of love remain forever. We don’t have any chairs or tables or doors made by You, Lord, when You were working as a carpenter, but we have Your Cross as the most expressive ‘Act of Love’. Besides, all our acts of love towards others are towards You, aren’t they?
On one occasion, St John of God found a starving beggar lying by the road seriously ill; he pick him up and carried him on his back to his home. There he washed his wounds and laid him on his own bed. As he was about to kiss the feet of the poor man, according to his usual custom, he noticed to his amazement that they had the same _pierced_ wounds of Christ’s feet. Looking up at the face of the beggar he found himself in front of Jesus’ lovely face, smiling and saying: "_Whatever you do to the needy and suffering, you do it to Me_". 
How I long for the day when You will look into my eyes, and smiling, You will remind me of the deeds of love I did, because _I did them all for You!_
