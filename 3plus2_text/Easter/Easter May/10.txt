TITLE: Sunday 10th May 
GOSPEL: Jn 15:9-17
"This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. You are my friends if you do what I command you ... You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide; so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you. This I command you, to love one another".

COMMENTS: I see the different things You say: You chose us to ‘give fruit’; we become Your friends if we do ‘what You command’; You command ”_to love one another_”; Conclusion: Love is the fruit that You expect. That’s the example that You left to Your disciples and Your disciples to us. 
We have a mission: to love one another. And to love them as You love them; to love them with ‘deeds’, which are the fruits that endure. The acts of love remain forever. We don’t have any chair or table made by You, Lord, but we have Your Cross as ‘The Act of Love’. Besides, all the acts of love that we have with the others, we have them with You, isn’t it?
On one occasion, St John of God found a beggar lying on the road seriously ill, and carried him on his back to the hospital. He washed his feet and laid him in a bed. As he was about kissing the feet of the poor man, according to his usual custom, he saw that they were _pierced_ like Christ’s. Looking at the face of the beggar he found himself in front of Jesus Himself, smiling and saying: "_Whatever you do to the needy and suffering, you do it to Me_".
