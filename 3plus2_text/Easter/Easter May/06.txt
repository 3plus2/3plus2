TITLE: Wednesday 6th May 
GOSPEL: Jn 15:1-8 
"I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser... If a man does not abide in me, he is cast forth as a branch and withers; and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire and burned. If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you."  
COMMENTS: If we remain in Him, and His words abide in us: "_ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you." Abide in Him is to be always in union, as a branch to the stalk. We also need to make sure that His Words abide in us; the Words of the Gospel that we meditate every day. Ask Him now to help you to keep His Words in you.
But the promise “_it shall be done for you_” doesn’t mean, obviously, that God is like a slave that has to give us ‘anything’ we ask for; for you know that we can ask for things that are no good for us. It can also happen that God may delay a bit the delivery of your wish, as St Augustine explains: "_He Who takes time to give wants to increase your desire with the delay, so that it does not seem of little value what He gives in the end_". So we need to insist when we ask. 
And then, of course, there are things more important than others to ask in your prayer. Joyce Kilmer, a soldier in WWII, wrote from the battle fields to a priest asking for prayers. He didn’t ask that life might be spared to him, that he might soon get back safely to his loved ones or that his family will be fine... no. He said: “_Pray for me, Father, that I may love God more and that I may be unceasingly conscious of Him. That is the greatest wish I have_”. This is one of the best things to ask for.
