TITLE: Wednesday 6th May
GOSPEL: Jn 15:1-8 
"I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser... If a man does not abide in me, he is cast forth as a branch and withers; and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire and burned. If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you."  
COMMENTS: If you and I remain in Him, and His words abide in us: "_ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you." That sounds like a great promise, doesn’t it? ‘whatever’ shall be ‘done for you’. And because we are very interested in that, we should be worried that we remain in Him.
To abide in Him is to be always in union, as a branch to the trunk. We also need to make sure that His Words abide in us; the Words of the Gospel that we meditate every day. Ask Him now to help you to keep His Words in you.
But the promise “_it shall be done for you_” doesn’t mean, obviously, that God is like a slave that has to give us ‘anything’ we fancy; for you know that we can ask for things that would do us no good. 
It can also happen that God may delay granting your wish. St Augustine explains, that He sometimes delays answering our prayers to increase our ‘_desire_’ for what we pray for and we really value what he has given us when it finally comes. So we need to insist when we ask. 
And then, of course, some things are more important to pray for than others. Joyce Kilmer, a soldier in WWII, wrote from the battle fields to a priest asking for prayers. He didn’t ask that his life might be spared; or that he might soon get back safely to his loved ones or that his family would be fine... no. He said in his letter: “_Pray for me, Father, that I may love God more and that I may be unceasingly conscious of Him. That is the greatest wish I have_”. This is one of the best things to ask for; you can do it now.
