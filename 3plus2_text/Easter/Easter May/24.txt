TITLE: Sunday 24th May (Pentecost)
GOSPEL: Jn 20:19-23 
Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, "Peace be with you." When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord. Jesus said to them again, "Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, even so I send you." And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained." 

COMMENTS: In the 1st reading of today’s Mass we hear the account of Pentecost, the day on which the growth rate of the Church exploded; when three thousand people from all walks of life listened to a fisherman speak about Jesus Christ, whose death they had asked for a few weeks before, and they asked to be baptized. 
O Peter! How can we recognize you now? You don’t run away today, and don’t hide for fear of the Jews; you now deploy more energy in preaching than you did before in hiding. A few days ago you, Peter, were frightened by the voice of a servant, and very soon you will stand unshakable under the blows of the chief priests. 
Who could now doubt the transforming power the Holy Spirit, when we can see this transformation in St Peter? Who wouldn’t pray to that same Spirit: ‘_Come, O Holy Spirit, do the same with me_’? The Holy Spirit can also convert me into an apostle like Peter if I let Him work in me, if I’m docile to Him. 
Holy Mary, my Mother, you were there on that day too. I can imagine your eyes glowing with love and joy as you saw that transformation in Peter, who you love. And you are now with me... every day... helping me to be docile to the Holy Spirit. And I can imagine your smile when you look at me, transformed by the Holy Spirit into another Peter, into a daring apostle of your Son, to tell everyone how much God loves them, and all that He has in store for them if they also become temples of the Holy Spirit!
