TITLE: Sunday 24th May. Pentecost 
GOSPEL: Jn 20:19-23 
Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, "Peace be with you." When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord. Jesus said to them again, "Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, even so I send you." And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained." 

COMMENTS: In the 1st reading of the Mass today comes the description of Pentecost, the day that the Church exploded; the day in which three thousand people from all walks of life listened to a fisherman about Jesus Christ and were baptized. 
O Peter! How can recognize you now? You don’t run away today, and don’t hide for fear of the Jews; you now deploy more energy preaching than before in hiding. Yesterday you were frightened by the voice of a servant, and now you stand unshakable under the blows of the chief priests: You, the same who recently fled and abandoned him when He was driven in front of the Council. Who could doubt the power of transformation of the Holy Spirit now? Who wouldn’t pray to that same Spirit: ‘_Come, O Holy Spirit, do the same with me_’?
Holy Mary, my Mother, you were there on that day as well; I can imagine your eyes glowing with love and joy as you saw that transformation. And you are now with me... every day... helping me to be ready for the Holy Spirit, to take after you: Mother, help me to be a good living temple of the Holy Spirit: a true Apostle!
