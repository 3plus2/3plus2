TITLE: Tuesday 19th May. 5th day of the Holy Spirit

GOSPEL: Jn 17:1-11a 
Jesus said, "I glorified thee on earth, having accomplished the work which thou gave me to do; ... I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou gave me out of the world; thine they were, and thou gave them to me, and they have kept thy word ... and I am glorified in them. And now I am no more in the world, but they are in the world. 

COMMENTS: Men are obliged to glorify God, to worship Him. And the best worship that men can give to God is when we glorify God with Jesus Christ. The summit of Christian worship is the Holy Mass; in it Jesus ‘_glorifies the Father on earth_’ and we (who are still in the world) unite ourselves to Him. For that reason there is nothing more important in the world than the Mass; one Mass; every Mass, because it is the Sacrifice of Jesus on Calvary. 
During the WW II, Nazis forced many priests into concentration camps and the majority were sent to Dachau Concentration Camp. At least 2,720 priests were together in a single area, the ‘_Priesterblock_’ and they were permitted to have a single altar in which to celebrate one Mass a day. One priest saying the Mass and many attended it. Bl Karl Leisner was the only man who was ordained a priest there. On December 17, 1944, against the orders of the Nazis, he became a priest after 5 years in concentration camps as a deacon. He said his first Mass on December 30; he was in such poor health, that that Mass became his first and last, his only Mass, before he died. None of the priest that witnessed that Mass could ever forget his love and devotion for the Mass. 
How would you attend the Mass if it were your first Mass, your Last Mass ... your only Mass?
