TITLE: Tuesday 19th May (5th day of devotion to the Holy Spirit)
GOSPEL: Jn 17:1-11a 
Jesus said, "I glorified thee on earth, having accomplished the work which thou gave me to do; ... I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou gave me out of the world; thine they were, and thou gave them to me, and they have kept thy word ... and I am glorified in them. And now I am no more in the world, but they are in the world. 
COMMENTS: Men are obliged to glorify God, to worship Him. And the best worship that men can give to God is when we glorify God with Jesus Christ. The summit of Christian worship is the Holy Mass; in it Jesus ‘_glorifies the Father on earth_’ and we (who are still in the world) unite ourselves to Him. For that reason there is nothing more important in the world than the Mass; each and every single Mass, because it is the Sacrifice of Jesus on Calvary. 
During World War II, Nazis forced many priests into concentration camps and most of these were sent to Dachau Concentration Camp. At least 2,720 priests were together in a single area, the ‘_Priesterblock_’ and they were permitted to have a single altar in which to celebrate one Mass a day. One priest said the Mass and others attended it. Bl Karl Leisner was a deacon who had already spent 5 years in concentration camps. On December 17, 1944, he was secretly ordained by a fellow prisoner, a French bishop. Already very ill with Tuberculosis, Leisner’s first Mass on December 30 was in fact his last. After that Mass he would never be able to say a second one, because soon after he died. Many priests who attended that Mass said that they could never forget his love and devotion for the Mass. They could see in his face during the Mass that he had prepared that Mass during his entire life.
It can help you to examine yourself: How would you attend the Mass if it were your first Mass, your Last Mass ... your only Mass? How can I improve?
