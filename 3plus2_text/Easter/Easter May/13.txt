TITLE: Wednesday 13th May. Our Lady of Fatima 

GOSPEL: Lk 11:27-28
As he said this, a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him, "Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts that you sucked!" But he said, "Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and keep it!"
COMMENTS: 98 years ago Our Lady appeared to three little shepherds who were 9, 8 and 6 years old. The message was basically twofold: ‘reparation for sins’ and ‘prayer for sinners’. An angel explained to them a year before: "_Make of everything you can a sacrifice and offer it to God as an act of reparation for the sins by which He is offended and in supplication for the conversion of sinners_."
Our Lady stressed the importance of praying the Rosary every day for peace. In this month of May could be a good resolution. In actual fact, a decade of the rosary takes you less than three minutes [you time it!].
Another principal part of the Message of Fatima is devotion to Our Lady’s Immaculate Heart, which is terribly offended by the sins of humanity. She showed them Her Heart, surrounded by piercing thorns (representing the sins against Her Immaculate Heart), and said that their sacrifices could help to console Her.
During the 2nd apparition, Our Lady explained that Jacinta and Francisco would go to Heaven very soon and Lucia was to be for more years on earth. Lucia asked with sadness: “_Am I going to be left alone?_” Our Lady said: "_No, my daughter. Are you suffering a great deal? Don't lose heart. I will never forsake you. My Immaculate Heart will be your refuge and the way that will lead you to God_."
