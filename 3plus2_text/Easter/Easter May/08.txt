TITLE: Friday 8th May 

GOSPEL: Jn 15:12-17  
"Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. You are my friends... No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you. You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide; so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you. This I command you, to love one another." 

COMMENTS: Free choice is part of the definition of friendship, isn’t it? You choose your friends, and Jesus chooses His. And in the list of His friends your name is written. But friendship, as you know, is like a delicate plant. You need to take care of it every day; you need at least to put it in the light and water it; but in particular seasons plants require more attention (prune, food, change of pot...).
Friends sometimes argue; they may have a crisis, but always make up; as we do in confession when we fail to our Friend Jesus Christ. But disagreement isn’t the main enemy of friendship: the main enemy of friendship is forgetfulness. If you forget your plant and neglect it... the plant die. The same with Jesus.
You chose me, Lord, to be your friend, and you made our friendship possible by giving Your Life for me on the Cross: there is no greater love than that. For that reason, I choose You as my best Friend; I want to grow in friendship with You every day, to be with You: help me not to forget You ever. “_This very moment I may, if I desire, become the friend of God_” (St Augustine).
