TITLE: Saturday 23rd May. 9th day of the Holy Spirit 
GOSPEL: Jn 21:20-25
This is the disciple who is bearing witness to these things, and who has written these things; and we know that his testimony is true. But there are also many other things which Jesus did; were every one of them to be written, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.
COMMENTS: This is the end of the Gospel of John, who saw all these things and many more. This witness couldn’t write everything. So Jesus sent the Holy Spirit and founded the Church. The meaning is clear: The Sacred Scripture isn’t everything; we need also what the Spirit has said through the apostles (Tradition) and their successors (Magisterium). In that way, the Holy Spirit can still reveal the content of the Scripture to us. 
That’s how Jesus made sure that everyone could receive His Words with their proper meaning. That’s the mission of the Church, governed by the Holy Spirit watching over the Scripture, the Tradition, and the Magisterium. How beautiful the Church is, and how much we should love her!
But not everyone sees her beauty. It is like the stained glass windows of an old cathedral: seen from the outside, the only thing you observe are strips of dark glass joined with black lead. However, seen from the inside, against the light, you will contemplate a spectacle of colours and figures that will take your breath away. The same happens with the Church. Seen from the outside, with a worldly vision, you don’t see anything but dark sides and miseries. But from the inside, with the eyes of faith, you will see a wondrous edifice, a perfectly assembled body a beautiful wife without blemish.
