TITLE: Saturday 16th May. St Simon Stock. 2nd day of the Holy Spirit
GOSPEL: Jn 16:23b-28 
Jesus said to his disciples: "I shall no longer speak to you in figures but tell you plainly of the Father. In that day you will ask in my name; and I do not say to you that I shall pray the Father for you; for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came from the Father." 
COMMENTS: I understand now that You don’t need to speak well of me to The Father, for He loves me madly already. It would be like trying to convince my mother that I am a good child when she loves me madly and says that [almost] all the time! God loves His children. 
In 1989 an earthquake collapsed many buildings in Armenia. A father run to his son’s school and found it demolished. He remembered the promise he had made to his son: "_No matter what, I'll always be there for you!_" He remembered where his son's classroom was and started digging through the rubble. Some people tried to stop him saying: "_It's too late!_" "_They're dead!_" or "_Go home!_" but he proceeded to dig stone by stone. Even the fire chief and the police tried to dissuade that man, but he just answered: "_Help me or leave me alone_”. No one helped him. He dug for 8 hours, 12, 24, 36 hours ... then, after 38 hours, he pulled back a boulder and shouted his son’s name. Then he heard his son's voice: "_Dad!? It's me, Dad! I told the other kids not to worry. I told 'em that if you were alive, you'd save me and than they'd be saved. You promised: 'No matter what, I'll always be there for you!' You did it, Dad!_" Fourteen more boys were saved that day because that father fulfilled his promise. 
Could ever God forget about me?
