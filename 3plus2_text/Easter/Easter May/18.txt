TITLE: Monday 18th May. 4th day of the Holy Spirit 
GOSPEL: Jn 16:29-33 
Jesus said to his disciples, "The hour is coming, indeed it has come, when you will be scattered, every man to his home, and will leave me alone; yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me. I have said this to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world." 

COMMENTS: Emperor Julian of the Roman Empire struggled against Christians with all his might. His zeal against the Christians surprised some because he had been brought up as a Christian. He determined to suffocate Christianity restoring the traditional pagan religions to supremacy; old temples were rebuilt and new ones started, pagan priesthood restored. At the end of his live, devoted to fight against the followers of Christ, the Galilean, he was grunting in agony with a spear shoved into his guts, on June 27, 363. He was only 32 years old. As he bled, the dying emperor groaned, "_You have won, O Galilean!_"
Since the beginning the enemies of Christ have certainly tried their best. But think about it. The Church survived and even flourished during centuries of terrible persecution, the Roman Empire, the barbarian invasions, wave after wave of Jihads, the age of revolution, Nazism and Communism. After 2,000 years there are over 1,000,000,000 Catholics in the world. 
We will always “_have tribulation; but be of good cheer_”, said Jesus, “_I have overcome the world_." _Christus vincit! Christus regnat! Christus imperat!_ [Christ wins! Christ reigns! Christ commands!] sings the Church: Christ always wins.
