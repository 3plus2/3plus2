TITLE: Monday 18th May (4th day of devotion to the Holy Spirit)
GOSPEL: Jn 16:29-33 
Jesus said to his disciples, "The hour is coming, indeed it has come, when you will be scattered, every man to his home, and will leave me alone; yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me. I have said this to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world."
COMMENTS: Jesus knew that His disciples were going to be scattered. He knew that over the years many Christians would have to leave their home and run away with their families as St Joseph had to do. Knowing this, He wanted to record in the memory of His disciples the fact that they would never be alone: God will be with them. 
Despite having been brought up a Christian, the Roman Emperor Julian persecuted the Church. He was determined to wipe out the religion of ‘the Galilean’, Christ, and restore pagan religion. Old temples were restored and new ones built, and the pagan priesthood was restored. However, at the end of his short 32 years of life, in AD 363, he realised that all his efforts to stamp out the message of Christ had failed. "_You have won, O Galilean!_" he said as he lay dying.
After 2,000 years there are over 1,000,000,000 Catholics in the world. The Church survived and even flourished despite times of terrible persecution by Romans, barbarians, and Saracens; and more recently from communism and Nazism. Those ‘kingdoms’ have come and gone, while the spiritual kingdom of Christ continues in the hearts of those who love him.
We therefore, can never be surprised, or be afraid of the difficulties that Christians may find in their lives. We need to be aware that we usually go against the grain. We will always “_have tribulation_”, said Jesus. But he didn’t finish there; let’s always keep fix in our souls the rest of the sentence: _be of good cheer, I have overcome the world_."
