GOSPEL: Jn 16:5-11 
But now I am going to him who sent me; yet none of you asks me, 'Where are you going?' But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your hearts. Nevertheless I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Counselor will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you. 
COMMENTS: It’s to our advantage that You, Lord, have to go, because then we can receive the Holy Spirit. Nevertheless sorrow fills the hearts of the Apostles because they won't be able to see You until the end of their lives, and they love You. I can understand it; You are the Light. And our lives are like hiking in a beautiful mountain capped with brilliant snow at the light of the sun. But when You aren't with us it's like the night: dark and freezing. 
One day in Rome, during an audience with St John Paul II, a lady was greeting the Pope with her husband. After a few sentences of introduction she took the hand of her husband, put it in the hands of the Pope and said: "_Holy Father, could you say something to my husband who doesn't want to go to confession?_" St John Paul II pressed the hand of that man and staring at his eyes answered: "_Go to confession. It's so hard to be away from God!_" (¡se está tan mal lejos de Dios!)
It's so hard to be away from You! Because we were meant to live with You, Lord. And we thank You, Lord that You have left us the Holy Spirit so that we be temples of Him and take Him all over the world as walking tabernacles of God. That’s what I am: a walking tabernacle that can bring God close to my friends and relatives: It’s so good to be with You!
