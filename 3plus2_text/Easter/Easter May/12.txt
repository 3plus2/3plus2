TITLE: Tuesday 12th May
GOSPEL: Jn 16:5-11 
"But now I am going to him who sent me; yet none of you asks me, 'Where are you going?' But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your hearts. Nevertheless I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Counselor will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you."
COMMENTS: It’s to our advantage that You, Lord, have to go, because then we can receive the Holy Spirit. Nevertheless sorrow fills the hearts of the Apostles when they realize that they won't be able to see You until the end of their lives, because they love You. I can understand it; You are the Light. And our lives with You are like hiking in beautiful mountains capped with brilliant snow in the light of the sun. But when You aren't with us night falls: the same landscape is dark and freezing. 
One day in Rome, during an audience with Pope St John Paul II, a lady was greeting the Pope with her husband. After a few sentences of introduction she took the hand of her husband, put it in the hands of the Pope and said: "_Holy Father, could you say something to my husband who doesn't want to go to confession?_" St John Paul II pressed the hand of that man and staring at his eyes answered: "_Go to confession. It’s so sad to be away from God!_”
It's so hard to be away from You! It is so gloomy, just like a beautiful landscape in the dark. We need the light. We are not bats. Our eyes were meant to see when there is light. And our souls were meant to see the world with the Light that comes from You.
And we thank You, Lord that You have left us the Holy Spirit so that we may be His temples and take Him all over the world as walking tabernacles of God. That’s what I want to be: a walking tabernacle that can bring God close to my friends and relatives, to give them light to see the world differently. It’s so good to be with You!
