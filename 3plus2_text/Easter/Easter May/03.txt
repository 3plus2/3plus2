TITLE: Sunday 3rd May 
GOSPEL: Jn 15:1-8 
Jesus said to his disciples: "Every branch of mine that bears no fruit, he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit ... As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me. I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in me, and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing. 
COMMENTS: The branch receives sap from the vine; but even if the branch is united to the vine, it doesn't give fruit automatically. It needs to want to transform the sap into fruit. We, Christians, are united to Christ and receive Life from Him; but we don't necessarily give fruit. We could become _spongers_ that take sap and give nothing; but those branches, in the words of Our Lord, are ‘taken away’. 
Saints give fruit, but they never forget that it’s Jesus (the Vine) who gives fruit through them; they were always aware that they are just branches, united to the Body of the Vine. And there is always something common and attractive in the life of all the saints: the ‘_disproportion_’ between their talents and their fruits. But what's a branch, anyway? It is part of the production of grapes if it receives the sap, or it becomes a stick for the fire if it isn't united to the vine.
We have to remain united to the Vine, the Body of Christ: the Church, because it connects us to the roots: God Himself. From the roots, the sap (supernatural grace) reaches to us, and then we can give apostolic fruit. Do I give fruit?
Jesus, keep me always perfectly united to You, perfectly alive, with Your Live: your grace.
