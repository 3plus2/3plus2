GOSPEL:Jn 15:9-11
Jesus said to his disciples: “abide in my love. If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love. These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full.” 
COMMENTS: Have you ever felt happy... very, very happy? Can you imagine what does it mean that our joy “_may be full_”? No, you can’t. Because human being still don’t know what fullness of joy means, how ‘_full_’ the human heart can be. If we ‘abide’ in the Love of God, we will be filled with that joy. The joy that all saints had: have you ever seen a sad saint?
Charles IX, King of France, once asked the poet Torquato Tasso: ‘Who do you think is the happiest person?’ —‘_God, most certainly_’, said Tasso. ‘_Bah! I know that; I mean among men_’ replied the king. ‘_The happiest man?_’, replied Tasso, ‘_he who is closer to God_’. Obviously: if we are close, He can fill up our souls with joy ‘to the brim’.
When she was a child, St Therese of Lisieux was upset to learn that not all souls enjoy the same joy in heaven. Her sister Pauline told her to get her thimble and her father's water tumbler and fill them with water. She asked Therese which was fuller. But neither was fuller than the other; one simply contained more because it was bigger. That was it! Each soul is filled to its brim and can hold no more; each, being full of God, is completely happy. 
Jesus, enlarge my heart, make me abide in Your Love, here on earth, and forever in eternity.
