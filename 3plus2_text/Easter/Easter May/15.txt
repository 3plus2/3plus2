TITLE: Friday 15th May. 1st day of devotion to the Holy Spirit 
GOSPEL: Jn 16:20-23 
Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn into joy. When a woman is in travail she has sorrow, because her hour has come; but when she is delivered of the child, she no longer remembers the anguish, for joy that a child is born into the world. So you have sorrow now, but I will see you again and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you. 
COMMENTS: Children of God should always be cheerful. Consider slowly this promise of Jesus: “_no one will take your joy from you_”: No one; ever!; even if the enemy may try very hard, (because he will). Know it well: gloominess is the scum of the enemy. And the joy of the children of God is as rubbing salt in his wound. St Paul said it: “_Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, Rejoice_” (Phil 4:4). 
We have our joy inside and nothing can touch it; like a child hidden inside of a large metal box: archers can discharge their arrows at it that the child will remain untouched. Nothing from the outside-no matter how hard- can touch it, unless we open the lid. 
In 1534 two martyrs were in trial for refusing to sign a formal document explicitly acknowledging Henry VIII as head of the church in England. The judge said plainly: ‘_If you don’t sign you’ll tied up and thrown into the Thames_’. The replay of them, with a big smile was: ‘_We just want to go to Heaven. We don’t really mind if it is by water or by land..._’ Consider slowly: “_no one will take your joy from you_”.
