TITLE: Saturday 24th January. St Francis of Sales (7th day of the Church Unity Octave)
GOSPEL: Mk 3:20–21 
Jesus came with his disciples into the house and the crowd came together again, so that they could not even eat. And when his family heard it, they went out to seize him, for people were saying, "He is beside himself."
 COMMENTS: St John Mary Vianney used to say: _To become a saint it's necessary to be crazy, to be out of your mind_. All the saints have been taken for crazy people by many. St John of God was taken to a mental asylum when he gave all his possessions to the poor. St Francis of Assisi was considered a fanatic. They tried to lock St John Bosco in a madhouse as well. And so many others!
Because Jesus was helping everyone without resting they said He was mad... And they were right! He was madly in love with men, and so He was giving them all His time and attention: His Life.
If you are to follow in Jesus' footsteps it would be normal that they think you are crazy: crazy because you do not think only about yourself; because you give yourself to the others; because you do not waste your time in trifles, but you spend it in good... in God; Because when others play, you pray...
...don't you? 
Do you really care what others think of you, or do you only care about what God thinks of you?
