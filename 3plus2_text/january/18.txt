TITLE: Sunday 18th January (1st day of the Church Unity Octave)GOSPEL: Jn 1:35–42The next day again John was standing with two of his disciples; and he looked at Jesus as he walked, and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God!" The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus. Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them, "What do you seek?" And they said to him, "Rabbi" (which means Teacher), "where are you staying?" He said to them, "Come and see." They came and saw where he was staying; and they stayed with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.
COMMENTS: _Come and see!_ It was such an important moment in John’s life that, more than 60 years later, he still remembered that moment: _it was at the tenth hour_... at four o’clock in the afternoon. How could he forget it! It was The Hour of his life! It was the beginning of a new life.
_Come and see!_ Come close to Jesus and see how He is, how He teaches, how He acts: Open the Gospel and _see!_ And they came and stayed with Him that day... and until the end of their lives, and for all eternity!
"_I want to invite you this year to fix your eyes on Jesus ... Teacher, where are you staying?" See that you are able to listen again, in the silence of prayer, to Jesus' answer: "Come and see_" (St John Paul II). My Lord, how do I _come_ to You and _see_ You in Your Gospels?
