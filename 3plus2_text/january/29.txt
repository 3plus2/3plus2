TITLE: Thursday 29th January
GOSPEL: Mk 4:21–25 And he said to them, "Is a lamp brought in to be put under a bushel, or under a bed, and not on a stand? For there is nothing hid, except to be made manifest; nor is anything secret, except to come to light. If any man has ears to hear, let him hear." And he said to them, "Take heed what you hear; the measure you give will be the measure you get, and still more will be given you. For to him who has will more be given; and from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away."
COMMENTS: You and I have the fire of Christ shining in our hearts; and that light cannot be hidden. A Christian is like the moon: it does not shine on its own, but reflects the light of the sun. We give light to the world by reflecting the light of Christ. And that is possible when the moon is in front of the sun, and the Christian in front of Jesus Christ. And that light cannot be hidden. 
Souls of prayer give the light of Christ to the world. Blessed Teresa of Calcutta writes: “_The filaments of light bulbs are useless if electricity does not pass through them. You and I are the filaments. God is the electricity. We can let the electricity pass through us and use it to produce light in the world_”.
But light can be irritating if we have been in darkness for a long time. Do not be surprised if people find it annoying to see you shining as a good disciple of Jesus Christ.
