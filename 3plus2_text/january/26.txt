TITLE: Monday 26th January. St Timothy and Titus
GOSPEL: Mk 3:22–30
And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, "He is possessed by Beelzebul, and by the prince of demons he casts out the demons." And he called them to him, and said to them in parables, "How can Satan cast out Satan? If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand ... But no one can enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man; then indeed he may plunder his house. "Truly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they utter; but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin"-- for they had said, "He has an unclean spirit." 
COMMENTS: They saw the miracle... but they did not like Jesus. So they accused him of being exactly the opposite of who He is. Jesus proves that that is nonsense: Satan cannot be casting out Satan. In fact, now Satan has lost his power, because Jesus has bound the _strong man_, who is Satan, by his death upon the cross. Now He can enter Satan's Kingdom and plunder his goods. 
Jesus has the power to cast out demons, all of them, of any kind. But we need to ask for help, we need to trust Him and know that whatever we do, the Mercy of God can heal and _undo_ all the evils we did. If we did not trust in the Mercy of God we could not be forgiven. And that is the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit that has no forgiveness.
