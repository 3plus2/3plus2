TITLE: Saturday 17th January. St Anthony Abbot
GOSPEL: Mk 2:13–17He went out again beside the sea; and all the crowd gathered about him, and he taught them. And as he passed on, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, "Follow me." And he rose and followed him.
COMMENTS: Matthew rose and followed him. Just like that! Jesus had chosen him to be with Him, to be close to Him, to be sent by Him to preach. He had been asked to leave everything there: his money, his job, his projects and future... his sins as well: to leave all that behind and start a new life with Jesus, to stop changing money, and start changing the world! God’s plan is always far better than our own. 
Pope Francis loves a painting by Caravaggio of this very moment of the life of Jesus. In it you find Jesus pointing at Matthew with his finger, like someone choosing a friend for his football team. “_That finger of Jesus, pointing at Matthew. That’s me. I feel like him. Like Matthew_” says the Pope: “_It is the gesture of Matthew that strikes me: he holds on to his money as if to say, ‘No, not me! No, this money is mine.’ Here, this is me, a sinner on whom the Lord has turned his gaze. And this is what I said when they asked me if I would accept my election as pontiff: “I am a sinner, but I trust in the infinite mercy and patience of our Lord Jesus Christ, and I accept in a spirit of penance_.”
It is not easy to follow Jesus. But if you do, you will never be happier.
