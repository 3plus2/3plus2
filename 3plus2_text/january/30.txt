TITLE: Friday 30th January
GOSPEL: Mk 4:26–34And he said, "The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed upon the ground, and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should sprout and grow, he knows not how. The earth produces of itself, first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear. But when the grain is ripe, at once he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come." And he said, "With what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable shall we use for it? It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when sown upon the ground, is the smallest of all the seeds on earth; yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes the greatest of all shrubs, and puts forth large branches, so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade." With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it; he did not speak to them without a parable, but privately to his own disciples he explained everything.COMMENTS: Both seeds have the same effect, you see? You bury it and the rain and the sun will make them grow. we just need to scatter the seed and put it in place. God pours His rain of grace on them. He himself is the Sun that gives them light. No matter who or how the sower is, if the soil is ready (if souls are ready), they always grow. Do you go through your life spreading that _seed_?
_The sower went out to sow, to scatter the seed at all the crossroads of this earth. What a blessed task we have. We have the job of making sure that in all the circumstances of time and place the word of God takes root, springs up and bears fruit. ... To sow. The sower went out... Scatter your seed, apostolic soul. The wind of grace will bear it away if the furrow where it falls is not worthy... Sow, and be certain that the seed will take root and bear fruit_ .
