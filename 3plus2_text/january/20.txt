TITLE: Tuesday 20th January (3rd day of the Church Unity Octave)
GOSPEL: Mk 2:23–28One sabbath he was going through the grainfields; and as they made their way his disciples began to pluck heads of grain. And the Pharisees said to him, "Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the sabbath?" And he said to them, "Have you never read what David did, when he was in need and was hungry, he and those who were with him?"... And he said to them, "The sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath; so the Son of man is lord even of the sabbath."
COMMENTS: How much the Pharisees loved their own rules! The Apostles hungry, and they just worried about their rules! They had more than six hundred of them. But they had forgotten the important commandment: "_Love God; love your neighbour_". In fact all the norms about the Sabbath were supposed to make it possible to sanctify the Day of the Lord. But they were more focussed on the rules than on the Lord. They thought that the Sabbath was just a day to stop doing things, instead of being a day to devote to God, and spend with God. 
For some people Sunday is just a _day off_, a day in which they _switch off_, some may even switch God off that day... It might be like a day to spend doing nothing, or at least, nothing _important_.
How do you sanctify the Day of the Lord? Is He the centre of your Sunday? Are you _holier_ on Sundays, more _sanctified_ or has it become just a _day off_?
