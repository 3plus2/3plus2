TITLE: Saturday 31st January. St John Bosco
GOSPEL: Mk 4:35–41
On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, "Let us go across to the other side." And leaving the crowd, they took him with them in the boat, just as he was. And other boats were with him. And a great storm of wind arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that the boat was already filling. But he was in the stern, asleep on the cushion; and they woke him and said to him, "Teacher, do you not care if we perish?" And he awoke and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, "Peace! Be still!" And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. 
COMMENTS: It is remarkable to see Our Lord so human and so divine! So human as to be tired enough to fall asleep in the middle of the storm. So divine as to command the wind and the sea and be obeyed. We love to read the life of Our Lord and see that He is a perfect man: He is tired, thirsty, hungry, and a few times He is also angry. We love to see that He is a man as we are, _in all things but sin_. So He can understand me perfectly when I am tired as well, or thirsty or hungry or angry, for He experienced that Himself centuries before I was born. 
What He seems not to understand is the lack of trust in Him. "_If I am with You_", He may think, _what do you fear?_ What do I fear? Do I trust Him?
