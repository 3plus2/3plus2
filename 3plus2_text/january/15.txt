TITLE: Thursday 15th JanuaryGOSPEL: Mk 1:40–45And a leper came to him beseeching him, and kneeling said to him, "If you will, you can make me clean." Moved with pity, he stretched out his hand and touched him, and said to him, "I will; be clean." And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean. And he sternly charged him, and sent him away at once... But he went out and began to talk freely about it, and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town, but was out in the country; and people came to him from every quarter.COMMENTS: "_If you will, you can make me clean_." There are so many things that Jesus wants to change in my life. But sometimes we fail to ask for it. If Jesus stretches out his hand and touches me, my misery is over: the stains of my past sins, all the dirt of my bad habits, all my lack of charity with others, my lack of obedience, my laziness, my stubbornness, my vanity, my pride, my critical thoughts, my selfishness, my cowardice to stand up for my faith before my friends... all would be over for ever if He touches me!
“_When you have fallen or when you find yourself overwhelmed by the weight of your wretchedness, repeat with a firm hope: Lord, see how ill I am; Lord, you who died on the Cross for love of me, come and heal me. Be full of confidence, I insist. Keep on calling out to his most loving Heart. As he cured the lepers we read about in the Gospel, he will cure you._” (St Josemaría).
