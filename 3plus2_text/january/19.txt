TITLE: Monday 19th January (2nd day of the Church Unity Octave)
GOSPEL: Mk 2:18–22Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting; and people came and said to him, "Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?" And Jesus said to them, "Can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast. The days will come, when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day.
COMMENTS: Some people think that we all have to do the same sacrifices, and that, if I am doing _this_, you _should_ do it as well; or even that fasting is the only sacrifice. There are days for fasting, and days for other sacrifices. In fact there are lots of small mortifications during the day that can be done even _when the bridegroom is with us_. Jesus said that we have to take up our cross _every day_; but He was not talking about fasting alone.
How is your spirit of penance? What mortifications do you offer up every day? Some are related with your work: attention in class, punctuality to get down to work, effort to do it properly, like Abel. Some are related with charity: always being friendly with everyone, especially when you find it more difficult. Some are related with family life: behave well towards your brothers and sisters, obey your parents, fulfil your jobs before you have to be reminded of them...
And do not forget to choose intentions to offer them up for.
