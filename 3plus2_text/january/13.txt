TITLE: Tuesday 13th JanuaryGOSPEL: Mk 1:21–28And they were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes. And immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out, "What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth?" But Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be silent, and come out of him!" And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him. And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, "What is this? A new teaching! With authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him."
COMMENTS: _They were astonished at his teaching_... they were listening to Him with admiration. Can you imagine the scene? How they listen to Him in amazement, “_for all the people hung upon his words_” (Lk 19). So many marvellous things have come from His mouth! We can hear so much good advice. Now, He also wants to speak to the world. But the world doesn’t seem to be willing to listen. 
A priest was one day going into the oratory and he found a little boy sitting on the priest's chair on the Sanctuary. He went up to him and asked why he was not sitting on the benches where the people sit. —_Because from down there I cannot hear Him!_, answered the child.
We do want to listen to You, Lord; and we beg You to keep us always in tune, so that we can hear so many marvellous things from Your divine lips in our prayer. 
Do I listen to Him in my prayer?
