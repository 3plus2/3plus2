TITLE: Wednesday 28th January. St Thomas Aquinas
GOSPEL: Mk 4:1–20He said to them: "Listen! A sower went out to sow. And as he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it. Other seed fell on rocky ground, where it had not much soil, and immediately it sprang up, since it had no depth of soil; and when the sun rose it was scorched, and since it had no root it withered away. Other seed fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no grain. And other seeds fell into good soil and brought forth grain, growing up and increasing and yielding thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold." 

COMMENTS: In many different ways God is communicating His Word to you. You read the Gospels, you meditate on them, you receive means of formation, you have been taught the catechism at home, at school, and in the parish... And for all that God will ask you to given an account. You and I are channels that God uses to spread His Word, and we are meant to give fruit.
Do you do apostolate? Do you give fruit for all the supernatural seed that God is pouring into your heart?
Because if you and I give no fruit, many will remain without seed... and will not be able to give fruit either... because of our neglect.
_Don't let your life be barren. Be useful. Make yourself felt. Shine forth with the torch of your faith and your love. With your apostolic life, wipe out the trail of filth and slime left by the corrupt sowers of hatred. And set aflame all the ways of the earth with the fire of Christ that you bear in your heart_ (St Josemaría).
