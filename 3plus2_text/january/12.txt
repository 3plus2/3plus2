TITLE: Monday 12th January
GOSPEL: Mk 1:14–20
Passing along by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net in the sea; for they were fishermen. And Jesus said to them, "Follow me and I will make you become fishers of men." And immediately they left their nets and followed him. And going on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who were in their boat mending the nets. And immediately he called them; and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and followed him.
COMMENTS: Have you ever seen such a simple and quick way to leave everything to follow Jesus? Think about it: @Immediately@ they left @everything@: nets, boat, profession, income, projects, home; even their father! Leaving all that, to follow Jesus, whom they do not yet know well, without knowing where they are going, nor what they are going to do, nor with whom, nor for know how long...
The future of the Church would rest on people without special talents. They are not like Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar or Charlemagne, whose empires have disappeared. 
Generosity, resolution, faithfulness: The Church today needs people like them: ready to leave @everything@ and @immediately@.
Do you follow Jesus immediately, as soon as you know what he wants from you?
What have you given to Jesus? What do you find difficult to give him? Have you asked God for help to give it, @immediately@, for Him?
