TITLE: Friday 23rd January (6th day of the Church Unity Octave)
GOSPEL: Mk 3:13–19 
And he went up on the mountain, and called to him those whom he desired; and they came to him. And he appointed twelve, to be with him, and to be sent out to preach and have authority to cast out demons: Simon whom he surnamed Peter; James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James, whom he surnamed Boanerges, that is, sons of thunder; Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Cananaean, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. Then he went home. COMMENTS: _He called to Him those He desired_ for no other reason than that: He just wanted those and no others... And appointed them _to be with Him_. What a marvellous appointment! He chose those He wanted to have closer, _to be with Him_ and He with them.
He did not choose the best, or the most talented, or the most likeable or sympathetic, those who had more friends or better position or knowledge... Just those He wanted; because He felt like it. And one reason was that when their work was done, no one should be able to say that it was the learning, or wisdom, or riches, or power of men by whom that work was accomplished. 
Jesus has not chosen you for your mission because you are better than others, for you are not! He chose you and no others because He wants to have you closer... _to be with Him_. Are you _with Him_, close to Him?
