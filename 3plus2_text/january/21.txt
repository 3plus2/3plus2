TITLE: Wednesday 21st January. St Agnes (4th day of the Church Unity Octave)GOSPEL: Mk 3:1–6Again he entered the synagogue, and a man was there who had a withered hand. And they watched him, to see whether he would heal him on the sabbath, so that they might accuse him. And he said to the man who had the withered hand, "Come here." And he said to them, "Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to kill?" But they were silent. And he looked around at them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart, and said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was restored. COMMENTS: They couldn’t deny the miracles. They just didn't like them and couldn't care less about the sick people. They had their rules! _Hardness of heart_ is a spiritual disease that makes someone blind to the needs of the others and also to see the goodness of God with the others. Jesus was angry with them, and they were angry with everyone. 
But His anger ended there; He only looked, but spoke no word. And the look itself was something special: _more compassion than passion_. He paused long enough to gaze upon each person, and to let him know what was intended by the glance. Nobody escaped the light of those expressive eyes. And He _grieved_ at their egoistic lives! How miserable is the life of the person who only thinks about himself!
If Jesus looks at you... what would He feel?
