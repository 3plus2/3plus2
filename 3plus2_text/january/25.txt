TITLE: Sunday 25th January. The conversion of St Paul
GOSPEL: Mk 1:14–20  Passing along by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net in the sea; for they were fishermen. And Jesus said to them, "Follow me and I will make you become fishers of men." And immediately they left their nets and followed him. And going on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who were in their boat mending the nets. And immediately he called them; and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and followed him. COMMENTS: We celebrate St Paul's conversion: from persecuting Christians to being persecuted himself. Like all the other Apostles, he followed Jesus _straightaway_. Jesus saw the flaws of his disciples many times, but never forgot their immediate response when He passed by and He called them to follow Him. He never forgot the quick conversion of Saul, nor the sudden reaction of Peter and Andrew to leave the nets and jump off the boat; nor even the smile of John and James when they looked back at their father like little children begging their mum: —_Please, let us go with him, please!_
He was also touched by the gesture of Zebedee, the father of James and John, smiling at them and waving goodbye, proud that the Master has chosen his children. 
Yes, Jesus knew their defects... and yours as well; but He looked at their generous, resolute and faithful heart. Do you think Jesus could be moved by your generosity as well?
