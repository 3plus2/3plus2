TITLE: Tuesday 27th January 
GOSPEL: Mk 3:31–35 And his mother and his brethren came; and standing outside they sent to him and called him. And a crowd was sitting about him; and they said to him, "Your mother and your brethren are outside, asking for you." And he replied, "Who are my mother and my brethren?" And looking around on those who sat about him, he said, "Here are my mother and my brethren! Whoever does the will of God is my brother, and sister, and mother."COMMENTS: It is not the first time that, when someone mentioned his Mother, He spoke about doing the Will of God. 
When Jesus taught His disciples to pray He told them to repeat to the Father: _Your Will be done_. When we pray this, could Jesus answer us back, saying "_If you want my Will done, then do it!_"? If they knew what they are asking for they would have to change their lives, or their prayers... Because Jesus was very clear: _Not everyone who says: Lord, Lord, will enter the Kingdom of Heaven, but those who @do@ the Will of my Father_, as Mary did: _Be it done to me according to your Word_. 
To do _God's Will_ was the goal upon which the saints constantly fixed their gaze. They were fully persuaded that in this consists the entire perfection of the soul. Our Lord frequently declared that he had come on earth not to do His own Will, but rather that of His Father: "_I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of Him that sent me_." And that other prayer of His: “_Not my will, but Yours be done_”. 
Can you also say that, honestly?
