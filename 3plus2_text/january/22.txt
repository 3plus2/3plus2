TITLE: Thursday 22nd January (5th day of the Church Unity Octave)
GOSPEL: Mk 3:7–12 Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea, and a great multitude from Galilee followed; also from Judea and Jerusalem and Idumea and from beyond the Jordan and from about Tyre and Sidon a great multitude, hearing all that he did, came to him. And he told his disciples to have a boat ready for him because of the crowd, lest they should crush him; for he had healed many, so that all who had diseases pressed upon him to touch him. 
COMMENTS: 
For a time, Jesus was very popular with crowds. Many people came because they wanted Jesus to cure them. And Jesus did cure them. He told people not to speak about this, but they did. The news about him spread everywhere. There were many miracles, e.g. He fed 5000 people by a miracle (_Jn_ 6:5-14). There are always lots of people who follow Jesus because of what they can @get@, but very few that follow Him for what they can @give@.
Lots of people pray because they need something. Few people pray because Jesus needs them. To the crowd He said: _The reason why you are looking for me is because I gave you plenty of bread to eat_. But when He needed them, at Calvary, they were nowhere to be found; just a few women, with our Lady, and the adolescent John. 
When you come to pray: do you mainly come to _get_ or to _give_? .... to ask for or to _give yourself_?
