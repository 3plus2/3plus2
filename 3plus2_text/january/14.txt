TITLE: Wednesday 14th JanuaryGOSPEL: Mk 1:29–39And in the morning, a great while before day, he rose and went out to a lonely place, and there he prayed. And Simon and those who were with him pursued him, and they found him and said to him, "Everyone is searching for you."COMMENTS: Everyone! Everyone is searching for happiness, searching for truth, searching for beauty... Everyone is searching for You! _My heart says to thee, “Thy face, Lord, do I seek.” Hide not thy face from me_ (Ps 26). Do I help people who are in search of God?
_“The desire for God is written in the human heart, because man is created by God and for God; and God never ceases to draw man to himself. Only in God will he find the truth and happiness he never stops searching for”_ [CCC, 27]
_He rose and went out to a lonely place, and there he prayed_... If you are looking for Him, you will find Him in prayer: Do not give up in your prayer: “_Seek, and you will find ... For everyone who seeks finds_”.
“_Up now, slight man! Flee, for a little while, thy occupations; hide thyself, for a time, from thy disturbing thoughts. Cast aside, now, thy burdensome cares, and put away thy toilsome business.” Every day try to “enter the inner chamber of thy mind; shut out all thoughts save that of God, and such as can aid thee in seeking him; close thy door and seek him. Speak now, my whole heart! Speak now to God, saying, I seek thy face; thy face, Lord, will I seek_” [_St. Anselm_, Proslogium].
