GOSPEL: Mt 5:17-19
"Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the prophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them. For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law until all is accomplished. Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
COMMENTS: How easy it is to water down the Gospel and make it _less demanding!_ How easy it would be to get disciples if you only taught the _nice_ bits of the Gospel, and took out any reference to the Cross or the demands of becoming a real disciple of Jesus! But the Gospel is the Word of God-the _whole_ Gospel-, and no one has the right to change so much as one letter of it.
A bishop returned to his home town – which was mostly non-Christian–soon after ordination. In the welcome speech, the people expressed how happy they were that one of _them_ had now direct access to God. They promised him they would all embrace Christianity if he would use his power to suppress one of the Ten Commandments for them. Before they could say which of the Commandments they had in mind, the young bishop shocked them explaining that the Commandments are from God and, therefore, unchangeable. The celebratory mood turned into disappointment and the bishop had to make a hasty departure from his own people.
But His words are clear: "_not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law until all is accomplished_"; God doesn't make mistakes.
