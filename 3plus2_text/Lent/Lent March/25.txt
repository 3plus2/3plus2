TITLE: Wednesday 25th March The AnnunciationGOSPEL: Lk 1:26-38And he came to her and said, "Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with you!" But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered in her mind what sort of greeting this might be. And the angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favour with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus”. COMMENTS: Today we celebrate the Annunciation, which is the Incarnation. God becoming Man. Jesus was already in the world nine months before Christmas, but only Mary and St Joseph knew it. Jesus was not in a hurry, you see? As perfect Man, he spends months in the womb, just as we did. He didn’t have to; but He wanted to. He didn’t want to be an exception.
Every time we say the _Hail Mary_, we remind Our Lady of the happiest moments of her existence, and she always listens to her children through this prayer:
A priest was asked by a hospital sister to visit patient number 7 in Ward 3. When he got there he found that the man hadn’t received the sacraments for many years, but had always kept up a promise made to his mother on her deathbed: _to pray three Hail Marys every night_. Eventually the man made his confession and received the Eucharist with great devotion. Leaving the Ward, the priest met the sister and found that he had been in Ward 4, and the patient 7 in Ward 3 was still waiting for him! This was soon put right, but the priest felt thankful for the mistake. He felt still more thankful when the following day he found out that the man in Ward 4 had died suddenly that night. 
_Now and at the hour of our death_...
