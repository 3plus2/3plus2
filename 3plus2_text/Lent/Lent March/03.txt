GOSPEL: Mt 23:1-12 Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples, "The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat; so practice and observe whatever they tell you, but not what they do; for they preach, but do not practice ... They do all their deeds to be seen by men ... He who is greatest among you shall be your servant; whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
COMMENTS: The best example of humility is God Himself: being God He became man for us. The second best example of humility is His Mother: being the only woman who could rightly boast, she recognized that all the good in her is a gift from God. The third example of humility is St Joseph: being a man gifted beyond comparison, he never let himself become the centre of attention. Saints are humble people who know how to remain in the background and let people see God instead. That is what holiness is about: you see? _Holiness and humility are proportionate_.
When we try to bring friends to God, do not rely on words, but on example. In the lifetime of the Holy Cure of Ars, St John Mary Vianney, people came from distant places to listen to his homilies. Elsewhere in France at the same time was another famous preacher who also attracted many people with his brilliant sermons. One day someone asked this preacher which of them was the _better preacher_. —_Most certainly he is!_, answered the man: _For when people listen to my homilies they say: “How good is this preacher!”, but when they listen to Vianney they say: “How good is God!”_.
Do people see God through your actions?
