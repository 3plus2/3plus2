GOSPEL: Jn 8:1-11 The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery, and placing her in the midst they said to him, "Teacher, this woman has been caught in the act of adultery. Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such. What do you say about her?" ... And as they continued to ask him, he stood up and said to them, "Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her." And once more he bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground. But when they heard it, they went away, one by one, beginning with the eldest, and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him. Jesus looked up and said to her, "Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?" She said, "No one, Lord." And Jesus said, "Neither do I condemn you; go, and do not sin again."
COMMENTS: How beautiful is the Mercy of God. He didn’t come to condemn, but to save. He forgives everything, always. And once forgiven: those sins exist no more. Confession erases everything as long as there is contrition. 
Mother Angelica was walking by the sea when suddenly, a huge wave crashed at her feet. Then she saw a small drop of seawater on her hand and she returned it to the sea. Then she heard the voice of Jesus: "_Angelica, have you seen that drop of water?_" —"_Yes, Lord_," she answered. —"_Those drops are like your sins, your weaknesses, your feebleness and your imperfections. And the ocean is like my Mercy. If you search for that drop, will you be able to find it?_ —_No, Lord_. —"_No matter how hard you try, won't you be able to find it?_" —"_No, Lord_." —"_Very well, then, why are you still searching for it?_”
