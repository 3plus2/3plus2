TITLE: Monday 16th MarchGOSPEL: Jn 4:43-54At Caperna-um there was an official whose son was ill. When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went and begged him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death. Jesus therefore said to him, "Unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe." The official said to him, "Sir, come down before my child dies." Jesus said to him, "Go; your son will live." The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went his way. As he was going down, his servants met him and told him that his son was living.
COMMENTS: "_Unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe_." It is true that many people loved to see Your signs, Lord: they were spectacular! Blind people see, deaf hear, paralytics walk around, multiplications of loaves and fish ... But these signs were always in Your presence. The miracle in today’s Gospel is different:
Jesus, it is as if you are telling the crowd: ‘Those of you who came looking for miracles are going to be disappointed. However, this man had the faith to know I would answer his prayer without any external sign’ – the official didn’t need to *see it*. That is the faith that You love, Lord; the faith that I’m asking for. 
Do you remember _Indiana Jones_ in “_The Last Crusade_”? He has to get across this seemingly bottomless chasm. His dying father, Sean Connery, is whispering “_You must believe boy, you must believe_.” And so Indiana Jones does: he courageously extends his foot out and then, thud, his foot lands on solid ground. The camera pans around and you can see a rock bridge that had been invisible to him before. Indiana Jones had summoned up enough faith to get across the chasm.
