GOSPEL: Jn 7:40-53
The officers then went back to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, "Why did you not bring him?" The officers answered, "No man ever spoke like this man!" The Pharisees answered them, "Are you led astray, you also? Have any of the authorities or of the Pharisees believed in him? But this crowd, who do not know the law, are accursed."
COMMENTS: Joke: The optician asks the lady: ‘_Which letter do you see in the screen?_’ -“_A_”, answers the lady. ‘_Please, concentrate_’, insists the annoyed optician: ‘_Which letter do you see there?_’ -“_A_”, repeats the lady. ‘_Come on, Madam!_’ the exasperated optician asks once more: ‘_Try again!_’ -“_A_”, she insists. The optician turns around to the screen, puts his glasses on and exclaims: ‘_Gosh! You were right!_’
Pharisees, like the optician, didn’t check before jumping to conclusions. These people were divided into two groups: those who listened to Him, and those who persecuted Him. Why didn’t the Pharisees believe in Jesus? Because they didn’t listen to Him. And today it is the same for those who do not read the Gospel: “_Ignorance of the Scriptures is ignorance of Christ_” said St Jerome. The power of the Word of Jesus! Those officers 'lost the battle' when they allowed themselves to listen to Jesus.
Jesus, I want to read your Gospels everyday; to listen to your Voice, to get to know You, to get to know myself!
"_I advised you to read the New Testament for some minutes every day, and to enter into each scene and take part in it, as one more of the characters. This is so that you incarnate the Gospel, so that it is 'fulfilled' in your life... and 'make others fulfil it_'” (St Josemaría).
