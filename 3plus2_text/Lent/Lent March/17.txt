TITLE: Tuesday 17th March
. St PatrickGOSPEL: Jn 5:1-16Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a pool, in Hebrew called Beth-zatha, which has five porticoes. In these lay a multitude of invalids, blind, lame, paralyzed. One man was there, who had been ill for thirty-eight years. When Jesus saw him and knew that he had been lying there a long time, he said to him, "Do you want to be healed?" The sick man answered him, "Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is troubled, and while I am going another steps down before me." Jesus said to him, "Rise, take up your pallet, and walk." And at once the man was healed, and he took up his pallet and walked. 
COMMENTS: 38 years!!! 38 years stubbornly trying to be healed in that pool and all to no purpose. He was resolute. He had seen many others get healed that way and he was going to try time and again until he got it himself: a _hopeless case_. No one helped him. But he had never asked help from the only Man that could have healed him. 
But You, Lord came without being called, and gave him a solution that he had never imagined. How many times we are obsessed with one single solution of a problem, when You, Jesus have a better one! That man spent 38 years trying to be thrown into the pool, and eventually was healed without a drop of water. 
But the complaint of the man gives us something to think about: "_Sir, I have no man_...”, not a single man helped him; no one ever told him: _Listen, forget the pool, go to Jesus, who is more effective, and would love to help you_... @Not a single man!@ 
Do I help people to ask Jesus for help? Am I embarrassed to speak to my friends about Him?
