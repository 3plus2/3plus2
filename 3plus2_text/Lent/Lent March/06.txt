TITLE: Friday 6th March 
GOSPEL: Mt 21:33-43, 45-46 "Hear another parable. There was a householder who planted a vineyard, and set a hedge around it, and dug a wine press in it, and built a tower, and let it out to tenants, and went into another country. When the season of fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants, to get his fruit; and the tenants took his servants and beat one, killed another, and stoned another. Again he sent other servants, more than the first; and they did the same to them. Afterward he sent his son to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.' But when the tenants saw the son, they said to themselves, 'This is the heir; come, let us kill him and have his inheritance.' And they took him and cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. When therefore the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?" They said to him, "He will put those wretches to a miserable death, and let out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the fruits in their seasons." 
COMMENTS: This is called “_breach of contract_”. When God gave them the vineyard gave them a mission: to produce grapes. Vineyard and mission came together. But this people wanted to keep the vineyard and get rid of the mission. Keep the vineyard and the grapes for themselves.
God has given you talents and mission, a mission to save souls, and they both come together. But has left you @free@, as the tenants: He is not snooping into, because He @trusts@ in you; and He is @patient@ (He did not destroy them after their first mistake).
But He will ask you for fruit as well...
