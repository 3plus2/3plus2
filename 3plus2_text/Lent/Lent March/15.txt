TITLE: Sunday 15th March
 _Laetare Sunday_ GOSPEL: Jn 3:14-21And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up, that whoever believes in him may have eternal life." For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God sent the Son into the world, not to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through him. 
COMMENTS: Today we celebrate _Laetare Sunday_: "_Rejoice, Jerusalem! Be glad for her, you who love her; rejoice with her_" we hear in the Entrance Antiphon. Why does the church invite us to rejoice in the middle of the penitential season of Lent? Because _God so loved the world that he gave his only Son_: salvation is just around the corner!
IIn 1456, while he was printing the first Bible, Gutenberg’s little daughter, Alice, came into the printing press and picked up a discarded sheet with only one line of print. It read: "_God loved the world so much that he gave_..." So Alice put the paper in her pocket thinking about the fact of God being so loving, and her face radiated with joy. Her mother noticed her changed behaviour and asked Alice what was it and Alice showed her mother the paper. Her mother read it and said, "_So, what did God give?_" "_I don't know_," said Alice, "_but if God loved us well enough to give us something, then we need not be so afraid of Him_."
Sure enough, Alice, it was not just _something_..., God has given us @His Son@! What else do we want? 
Thank you, Lord. Thank you so much!
