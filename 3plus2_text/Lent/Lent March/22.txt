TITLE: Sunday 22nd March GOSPEL: Jn 12:20-33 Now among those who went up to worship at the feast were some Greeks. So these came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and said to him, "Sir, we wish to see Jesus." Philip went and told Andrew; Andrew went with Philip and they told Jesus. 
COMMENTS:Do you see? These Greeks have probably heard all sorts of stories about Jesus, but they don’t want to listen to other people talking about Jesus when they can actually meet Him. But they didn't dare to approach the Master directly, so they looked for a good intercessor: the Apostle Philip, because they know that Philip is His friend: “_we wish to see Jesus_.” Philip himself wants to bring Andrew with him when he introduces these people to Jesus.
“_We wish to see Jesus_”, people of our times cry as well. And when they see His disciples, they ask for Jesus. If we are friends of Jesus, people will come to us to get to Jesus. That is the mission of the apostle. 
“_We wish to see Jesus_”, people say; and we, Christians are the ones responsible for making sure they do. If Philip hadn’t brought them to Jesus they would have never met and loved Him. And if we do not bring souls to Him, they will remain in darkness.
You and I have a mission: the crowd want to see Jesus; they may not say it or even know it, but their hearts long for Him. And we will go to them and break the good news: —_You know what? He is there, in the Tabernacle, and wishes to see you! He has desired to see you for centuries and is waiting for you_. 
Don’t make _Him_ wait anymore. Don’t make _them_ wait anymore!
