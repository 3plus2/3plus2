TITLE: Monday 30th March. Monday of Holy Week GOSPEL: Jn 12:1-11 Mary took a pound of costly ointment of pure nard and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment. But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (he who was to betray him), said, "Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?" This he said, not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief, and as he had the money box he used to take what was put into it. Jesus said, "Let her alone, let her keep it for the day of my burial. The poor you always have with you, but you do not always have me." 
COMMENTS: Judas didn’t like Mary’ generosity towards Jesus; he didn’t like money being spent on Him; he didn’t like Jesus; he didn’t like Mary... he didn’t like anyone but himself!
Everywhere was filled with the fragrance of the ointment, and the face of Jesus was full of gratitude. Mary’s love made Jesus very happy, even though His Passion was near. The first Good Friday was close at hand. How good to be among friends! Let us not forget the solitude of Jesus during these days. 
Mary, for her part, was filled with joy when she saw that Jesus smiled because of what she had done. She loved Our Lord so much that nothing was too much for Him. “_If we stop to contemplate this scene for a few minutes, we can see the joy that comes from the generosity in the happy face of Mary, who has just made good use of a small treasure. And on the other hand, we see Judas filled with sadness, the sadness resulting from the lack of generosity_” (Cfr. Fernandez Carvajal, The Day That I Changed My Life; 2009. Sinag-tala).
