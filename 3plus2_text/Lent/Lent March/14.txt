TITLE: Saturday 14th March
GOSPEL: Lk 18:9-14"Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, 'God, I thank thee that I am not like other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week, I give tithes of all that I get.' But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, 'God, be merciful to me a sinner!' I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other." 
COMMENTS: How ridiculous the prayer of the Pharisee is! He likes to compare himself with others to prove that he is good! How ridiculous it would be if we prayed like this: ‘_Thank you, Lord, for I’m not like the others: I use the iPray, go to Mass during the week, pray my 3 Hail Marys and do the washing-up on Tuesdays... but other people of my class, well, they lie, copy their homework, cheat in tests..., they do not go to Mass even on Sunday!_...’ We cannot compare because we are all different and only God fully knows the different circumstances of each person. Lent is a time for penance and atonement, a time to ask for forgiveness for we are sinners. 
They say that one day Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, visited a prison and talked with the inmates. Apparently all of them were innocent and imprisoned by mistake. Finally the king stopped at the cell of a convict who remained silent. “_Well_,” remarked Frederick, “_are you an innocent victim too?_” “_No, sir, I'm not_,” replied the man. “_I'm guilty and deserve my punishment_.” Turning to the warder the king said, “_Here, release this rascal before he corrupts all these fine, innocent people in here!_”
