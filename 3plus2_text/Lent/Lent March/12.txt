GOSPEL: Lk 11:14-23 Some people said, "He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of demons"; ... But Jesus said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and a divided household falls. And if Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? ... When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own palace, his goods are in peace; but when one stronger than he assails him and overcomes him, he takes away his armour in which he trusted, and divides his spoil. 
COMMENTS: Evil is not an impersonal force that just happens. It has a name (actually has many: 'satan', 'Beelzebul, the prince of demons', 'the deceiver', 'the father of lies', 'Lucifer', 'the fallen angel') and it seeks to master every heart and soul by sin. 
He who habitually gives in to temptation leaves the door of his soul unlocked and allows the devil to come in and ‘make himself at home’. It is easy to defend oneself from inside a house; especially if one is _fully armed_ as the devil is. But Jesus is stronger: stronger than doors, locks, walls and windows, and stronger than the devil and his weapons. Let’s repeat it often: _the devil has no chance against me if Jesus is with me!_
But we need to go to Him in time of temptation and ask for help; otherwise we will have no chance. A Christian facing temptation who doesn't ask Jesus for help is like a gladiator in the arena, surrounded by ten hungry and angry lions, and armed... with a tea spoon! He has no chance. However, with the help of Jesus we are like the same gladiator but inside a _tank_: the lions have no chance. Jesus, do not leave me alone when the enemy comes; and if I ever forget to ask you to help me, help me anyway!
