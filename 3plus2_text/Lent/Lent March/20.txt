TITLE: Friday 20th March
GOSPEL: Jn 7:1-2, 10, 25-30
 Some of the people of Jerusalem therefore said, "Is not this the man whom they seek to kill? And here he is, speaking openly, and they say nothing to him! Can it be that the authorities really know that this is the Christ? Yet we know where this man comes from; and when the Christ appears, no one will know where he comes from." So Jesus proclaimed, as he taught in the temple, "You know me, and you know where I come from? But I have not come of my own accord; he who sent me is true, and him you do not know. I know him, for I come from him, and he sent me." 
COMMENTS: “_We know where this man comes from_...” They are perplexed: they are waiting for the Messiah; they think that Jesus might even be He, in view of the miracles He works and the doctrine He teaches; but they are not sure... because it doesn’t match with what they “know”. Oh, no! You can’t fool them for “_they know_”!
They loved to classify people. They _know_ where Jesus was from and therefore, they _thought_ they knew everything about Him. The Messiah was right in front of them... but they _know_ that the Messiah can’t be from here or there... But there is more than meets the eye. What they couldn't see, we in our prayer can know. We want to know You Lord, better each day with our prayer. May we be able to say one day: “_I know Him_”! 
«_Many people do not know or do not want to know who Jesus Christ is, and they remain perplexed and disconcerted... The great tragedy of history is that Jesus is not known, and therefore is not loved, not followed. You know Christ! You know who he is! Yours is a great privilege! Always be worthy and aware of it!_» (St John Paul II)
