GOSPEL: Jn 5:17-30 But Jesus answered them, "My Father is working still, and I am working." ... "Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing; for whatever he does, that the Son does likewise. For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all that he himself is doing; and greater works than these will he show him, that you may marvel ... "I can do nothing on my own authority; as I hear, I judge; and my judgment is just, because I seek not my own will but the will of him who sent me. 
COMMENTS: Today’s Gospel follows immediately on from yesterday’s account of the healing of the crippled man by the pool. Apparently some Jews thought that healing on the Sabbath was a bad idea. But You, Lord, answer that Your Father is working on the Sabbath, and You are too, for You do what He says. 
You are a Good Son, always doing what Your Father wants; in perfect unity with Him. That is what good children do: they learn everything from their father. They take after their father in the way they move, they speak, they act... Sometimes it happens that someone tells me: “_you remind me a lot of your father_.”
That was Your mission, Jesus: “_to remind us of Your Father_”, so that we become good children of God the Father, because we learn from You to do always and in everything the Will of the Father. Jesus: May I always do what You want!
“_It only takes a second. Before setting about anything, ask yourself: What does God want of me in this? Then, with divine grace,... do it!_” (St Josemaría)
