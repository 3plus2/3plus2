GOSPEL: Mk 12:28-34
And one of the scribes came up and asked him, "Which commandment is the first of all?" Jesus answered, "The first is, 'Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one; and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.' The second is this, 'You shall love your neighbour as yourself.' There is no other commandment greater than these.”
COMMENTS: The man asked for “_the first commandment_", but Jesus answered quoting “_the first and the second_”. There is an poem written by Leigh Hunt about a man called Abou Ben Adhem who woke from his sleep one night and saw an angel writing in a book the names of those who love God. "_And is mine one?_" inquired Abou. "_Nay, not so_," replied the angel. "_I pray thee, then,_" said Abou, "_write me as one who loves his fellow men._" The following night the angel came again and displayed the names of those who love God and Abou Ben Adhem's name topped the list, making the point that true love of God and true love of our neighbour are like two sides of the same coin.
The persecution of Jesus and his followers was championed by well-meaning religious people motivated by what they believed to be love for God. The people who ask about the first commandment are the same ones trying to entrap and kill Jesus. If they are so concerned about the love of God, why are they so insensitive when it comes to love of neighbour? "_Those who say, 'I love God,' and hate their brothers or sisters, are liars; for those who do not love a brother or sister whom they have seen, cannot love God whom they have not seen_" (1 Jn 4:20).
