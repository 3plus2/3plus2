TITLE: Saturday 28th March
GOSPEL: Jn 11:45-56Many of the Jews therefore, who had come with Mary and had seen what he did, believed in him; but some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. So the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the council, and said, "What are we to do? For this man performs many signs. If we let him go on thus, every one will believe in him, and the Romans will come and destroy both our holy place and our nation." But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, "You know nothing at all; you do not understand that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation should not perish." 

COMMENTS: When someone doesn’t want to believe for all the miracles they might see, they won’t believe. Read the entire chapter 11 of St John, if you can, to get the idea: Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead after being buried for four days in his tomb. Everyone saw the miracle but some went to inform the Pharisees, who decided to kill Jesus for performing miracles!!! Can you believe it? 
Anyway, Jesus came to give His life freely. Tomorrow we start the Holy Week; a week of intense prayer to be spent with Him. Jesus won’t die on the Cross alone this time: You and I will be there: “_My Lord and my God, under the loving eyes of our Mother, we are making ready to accompany you along this path of sorrow, which was the price for our redemption. We wish to suffer all that You suffered, to offer you our poor, contrite hearts, because you are innocent, and yet you are going to die for us, who are the only really guilty ones. My Mother, Virgin of sorrows, help me to relive those bitter hours which your Son wished to spend on earth_” (St Josemaría).
