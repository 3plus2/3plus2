GOSPEL:Lk 6:36-38
"Be merciful, even as your Father is merciful. Judge not, and you will not be judged; condemn not, and you will not be condemned; forgive, and you will be forgiven; give, and it will be given to you; good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, will be put into your lap. For the measure you give will be the measure you get back."
COMMENTS: We are very good at seeing other people’s mistakes and not quite as good at recognising our own. We need to ask You, Lord, to see things with Your eyes. 
The real measure of a person is how they measure others. Those who see the best in their relatives and friends are probably nice people who are fun to be with. Someone who is always criticising and cynical usually have a lot wrong inside. They try to find in others what they don’t want to see in themselves.
In the letters of a girl who died from cancer at the age of fourteen, there is something remarkable. Apparently, for Alexia -that was her name- everyone was wonderful: "_The hospital is a wonderful place. The nurses are so kind, so loving! Then doctors began arriving, all of them charming, and everyone was nicer and more adorable than the previous one_”. Even the city “_is a small town, very nice. Everyone is lovely, very friendly, and endearing_.“ It takes a very clear soul to see the world so brightly. You have to be charming to discover that everyone around you is charming too. The dirt is there, and it is not a crime to notice it. But those who constantly talk about dirt might be in need of an 'interior clean'. 
Do you judge others? What is the usual verdict?
