TITLE: Thursday 19th March. St Joseph
GOSPEL: Lk 2:41-51a 
... After three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions; ... and his mother said to him, "Son, why have you treated us so? Behold, your father and I have been looking for you anxiously." And he said to them, "How is it that you sought me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father's house?" And they did not understand the saying which he spoke to them. And he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was obedient to them. 
COMMENTS:St Joseph: what a saint! “Good and faithful servant”, husband of Mary and father of Jesus, my father and lord, always in the background. You were the protector of the Holy Family: protect our families today in this special year. 
“_Go, then to Joseph, and do all that he shall say to you; Go to Joseph, and obey him as Jesus and Mary obeyed him; Go to Joseph, and speak to him as they spoke to him; Go to Joseph, and consult him as they consulted him; Go to Joseph, and honour him as they honoured him; Go to Joseph, and be grateful to him as they were grateful to him; Go to Joseph, and love him, as they love him still_” (St Alphonsus).
Jesus "_was obedient_", says the Gospel; that’s what He had learned at home, from Joseph: obedient to God’s Will. “_I like St Joseph very much. He is a strong man of silence. On my desk I have a statue of St Joseph sleeping. While sleeping he looks after the Church. Yes, he can do it! We know that. When I have a problem or a difficulty, I write it on a piece of paper and I put it under his statue so he can dream about it. This means please pray to St Joseph for this problem_.” (Pope Francis, January, 2015). Do I ask St Joseph to pray for anything I need?
