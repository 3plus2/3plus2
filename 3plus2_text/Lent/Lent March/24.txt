GOSPEL: Jn 8:21-30 Again he said to them, "Where I am going, you cannot come ... You are from below, I am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world. I told you that you would die in your sins, for you will die in your sins unless you believe that I am he." They said to him, "Who are you?" 
COMMENTS: Isn’t it sad that those who had been with Him for so long even now ask “_Who are You?_” Don’t you feel sorry for all those who seek Him, but don’t find Him? Souls! So many of them! Saints had that passion (it’s called _zeal_) to reach out to everyone and explain to them who Jesus Christ is, and where He is so that they can go to Him. To tell them that Jesus has died for them and that it is, in actual fact, He who is looking for each one of them.
Jesus asked Bl Teresa of Calcutta to take His love to all souls in the streets. To do that, she had to overcome many difficulties and was a bit afraid of taking that final step of leaving her convent walls; but Jesus was in a hurry to reach all those souls, and was spurring her on to go for those souls that weren’t finding Jesus and didn’t know Him yet: ‘_You have come to India for me. Are you now afraid to take one more step for me? Has your generosity cooled down? Am I only secondary for you? You did not die for souls; that’s why you don’t care what happens to them. Your heart was never drowned in sorrow as was my Mother’s heart. We both gave up ourselves totally for souls. What about you? ... Will you refuse?_'
She didn’t refuse, as you know, and brought Jesus to thousands of those souls. Now we have a similar mission: _Will you refuse it?_
