TITLE: Tuesday 31st March. 
Tuesday of Holy Week 
GOSPEL: Jn 13:21-33, 36-38 Jesus said, "'Where I am going you cannot come.' Simon Peter said to him, "Lord, where are you going?" Jesus answered, "Where I am going you cannot follow me now; but you shall follow afterward." Peter said to him, "Lord, why cannot I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you." Jesus answered, "Will you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly, I say to you, the cock will not crow, till you have denied me three times. 
COMMENTS: Peter did love, but he was weak. He was convinced of what he would do for Jesus, but didn’t know himself well. He would use the sword against the guard of the High Priest and tremble before a little servant. Peter the Rock, the head of the apostles denied Jesus three times, swearing by God that he did not know Him, just to save his own skin. He was not the only one. St Matthew and St Mark explain in their Gospels that the other disciples said the same about dying with Him but the rest of the apostles, except John, took to their heels and abandoned him.
We also told You, Lord, that You could count on us, and then, so often we failed to be generous. We forget, like Peter and James and Andrew and the others, that we are weak if we are not humble. We are weak when we don’t ask You for help, when we try to do something on our own. 
Help me Lord to never trust myself; remind me to go to You anytime I want to do something for You, because without You I can’t please You. Jesus, never leave me alone, even if I fail to ask You for help. Don’t leave me because without Your grace I’m lost!
