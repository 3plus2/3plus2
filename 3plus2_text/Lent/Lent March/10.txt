TITLE: Tuesday 10th March
GOSPEL: Mt 18:21-35Then Peter came up and said to him, "Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times?" Jesus said to him, "I do not say to you seven times, but seventy times seven. 
COMMENTS:Jesus tells the parable of the man who was forgiven his debt by his master, but he didn’t forgive a fellow debtor, and in the end his own debt is claimed again because he didn’t have mercy on his servant. “_So also my heavenly Father will do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother from your heart_."
How many times we ask God: ‘_Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us_’. We do not ask Him to forgive ‘_all my trespasses_’, or ‘_my trespasses according to Your Mercy_’, or ‘_because you are Good_’. We persistently say: _Jesus, forgive me if I forgive, but if I do not forgive... please, do not forgive me!_ 
On Good Friday, 1003, a young man named John Gualberto surrounded by his gunmen, came across the murderer of his only brother, on their way to Siena. The criminal had no escape. In a sudden outburst, the villain dismounted, knelt down, and said: "_Today is Good Friday. For Christ dead for us on the Cross: spare my life!_" John was about to strike the fatal blow when the man muttered: "_Jesus, Son of God, at least you forgive me_." Upon hearing this, John threw the sword away, raised the murderer and embraced him saying: "_For Christ's sake, for His blood poured out on the Cross for US, I forgive you_." 
Forgiveness opened his heart: Soon after, John entered a Benedictine monastery... and became St John Gualberto.
