TITLE: Wednesday 4th March 
GOSPEL: Mt 20:17-28 Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came up to him, with her sons, and kneeling before him she asked him for something. And he said to her, "What do you want?" She said to him, "Command that these two sons of mine may sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your kingdom." But Jesus answered, "You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am to drink?" They said to him, "We are able." He said to them, "You will drink my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father." ... whoever would be great among you must be your servant, and whoever would be first among you must be your slave; even as the Son of man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."
COMMENTS: There is no better example of service that to see God-man washing the feet of His disciples. We should keep always that picture in mind when service becomes a burden. Lent is _time of service_ which is charity, and the disciples of Jesus follow His footsteps and example. 
“_If we let Christ reign in our soul, we will not become authoritarian. Rather we will serve everyone. How I like that word: service! To serve my king and, through him, all those who have been redeemed by his blood. I really wish we Christians knew how to serve, for only by serving can we know and love Christ and make him known and loved_” (St Josemaría).
How do I serve others, at home, in the school... everywhere?
