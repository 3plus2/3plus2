TITLE: Sunday 1st March 
GOSPEL: Mk 9:2-10 
Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, and led them up a high mountain apart by themselves; and he was transfigured before them, and his garments became glistening, intensely white, as no fuller on earth could bleach them. And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses; and they were talking to Jesus. And Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it is well that we are here; let us make three booths, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah." For he did not know what to say, for they were exceedingly afraid. And a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice came out of the cloud, "This is my beloved Son; listen to him."  COMMENTS: How good it is to be with You, Lord; and to be able to talk to You as Elijah and Moses did, face-to-face! And we still listen to the echoes of the Voice of the Father giving us a commandment: @listen to him!@
How I would love to listen to You as Moses did, as Elijah, and Peter and James and John...! And to Peter, who _did not know what to say_ I answer: —_Say nothing! It is time to keep silent and contemplate_. We have to learn from the contemplative silence of Mary and Joseph. Keep interior silence and you will hear His voice: _For while gentle silence enveloped all things, and night in its swift course was now half gone, thy all-powerful word leaped from heaven, from the royal throne_, we read in the Book of Wisdom (Wis 18). 
_We need to find God, and God cannot be found in noise and restlessness. God is the friend of silence_ (Bl Teresa of Calcutta).
