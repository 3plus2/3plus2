GOSPEL: Lk 4:24-30
And he said, "Truly, I say to you, no prophet is acceptable in his own country. But in truth, I tell you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when there came a great famine over all the land; and Elijah was sent to none of them but only to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow. And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha; and none of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian." When they heard this, all in the synagogue were filled with wrath. And they rose up and put him out of the city, and led him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, that they might throw him down headlong. But passing through the midst of them he went away.COMMENTS:
 Imagine the _‘Poets’ Society of Stratford-upon-Avon’_ suing Shakespeare for publishing his work without their approval: it would have been ridiculous! Well, the people of Nazareth were about to throw Jesus down the cliff just because He was chosen by God without _their_ permission. Apparently Jesus’ hometown neighbours couldn’t believe that God would choose the “Son of Joseph” instead of one of 'them'. And because they don’t like what He says... they want to kill Him!
There are some things that people just don’t want to listen to, or are not interested in knowing or changing. They could have told Jesus: ‘Listen, it is fine if You perform miracles here... we love that stuff... but do not try to give as lessons in this or that, because You are the son of Joseph’. 
Every disciple of Jesus always finds resistance. People may let Christians teach _some parts_ of the Gospels or some commandments, but not _all of them_. But Jesus does not change His message; and we Christians can’t either:
"_But passing through the midst of them he went away_."
