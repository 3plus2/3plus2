TITLE: Friday 27th March
GOSPEL: Jn 10:31-42The Jews took up stones again to stone him. Jesus answered them, "I have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of these do you stone me?" The Jews answered him, "It is not for a good work that we stone you but for blasphemy; because you, being a man, make yourself God." Jesus answered them, "... do you say of him whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world, 'You are blaspheming,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God? If I am not doing the works of my Father, then do not believe me; but if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father." COMMENTS: Poor people! No matter how many miracles they saw, they would not believe: they were blind because they didn’t want to see. They always got the wrong end of the stick: they want to stone Him because _being a man_, He _made himself God_, when it was exactly the opposite: _being God, He made Himself a man!_
They thought Jesus had a problem and wanted to kill Him, when the problem was theirs. They thought Jesus wasn’t sound, but it was they who were deaf: 
An old man thought that his wife had a hearing problem. So, while she is sitting in her lounge chair, he went behind her and said softly: “_Honey, can you hear me?_” He got no response. He moved a little closer and repeated: “_Honey, can you hear me?_” No response. Finally he moved right next her and said: “_Honey, can you hear me?_” This time she looked up with surprise in her eyes and replied: “_For the third time, Henry, Yes, I can hear you!_” Who really had the hearing problem, the man or his wife?
