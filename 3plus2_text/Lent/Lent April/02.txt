Maundy Thursday
GOSPEL: Jn 13:1-15 Now before the feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end. 
COMMENTS: This is the introduction to the washing of the dirtiest feet in Jerusalem (including Judas’) and the Institution of the Sacrament of the Eucharist: He loved us _to the end_. Think about it: He couldn't give us more, He gave Himself to us in the Eucharist.
Love is repaid with love; He loved you _to the end_... How do you love Him? Today is a day to _watch_ before the Eucharist: “_remain here, and watch with me_” (Mt 26:38).
"_When you look at the Crucifix, you understand how much Jesus loved you then. When you look at the Sacred Host you understand how much Jesus loves you now_" (Bl Teresa of Calcutta).
“_Do you realize that Jesus is there in the tabernacle expressly for you - for you alone? He burns with the desire to come into your heart...don't listen to the demon, laugh at him, and go without fear to receive the Jesus of peace and love... Receive Communion often, very often... there you have the sole remedy, if you want to be cured. Jesus has not put this attraction in your heart for nothing... The guest of our soul knows our misery; He comes to find an empty tent within us - that is all He asks_" (St Therese of Lisieux).
"_God's love for his creatures is so boundless and our response to it should be so great that time ought to stand still when Holy Mass is being said_" (St Josemaría).
