GOSPEL: Mt 26:14-25
Judas Iscariot went to the chief priests and said, "What will you give me if I deliver him to you?" And they paid him thirty pieces of silver ... When it was evening, he sat at table with the twelve disciples; and as they were eating, he said, "Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me." And they were very sorrowful, and began to say to him one after another, "Is it I, Lord?" He answered, "...The Son of man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born." Judas, who betrayed him, said, "Is it I, Master?" He said to him, "You have said so." 
COMMENTS: What has happened, Judas, to your soul? How have you become so miserable? You, an _apostle_, one of those who Jesus met and told: '_Come, follow me_'. And you did follow Him! You saw the miracles, and surely, you loved Jesus for a while. The best moments of your life happened in the company of Jesus. The days in which you could go to sleep smiling were ones when you had seen and heard wonders. You were so privileged: "_many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you saw, and did not see it, and to hear what you heard, and did not hear it_".
“_Then after the morsel, Satan entered into_” you, for the door had been opened wide little by little, when you started neglecting the time spent with Jesus, and you became inattentive to His Words; thinking about yourself, and your future, your plans, your life... Your drama was pre-announced when you stopped praying, when you stopped telling Jesus what was going on in your soul. 
And Jesus cried for you, because He loved you so much!
