Saturday 4th April. 
Holy Saturday 
GOSPEL: Jn 1:2 Hola
COMMENTS: On Holy Saturday the Church watches at the Lord's tomb, meditating on his suffering and death. The altar is left bare, and no Mass is celebrated. The earth is in silence. Heaven is in silence too, for the angels have not forgotten what men did to God yesterday... The King is sleep. Even animals are still, birds don’t sing today; the wind doesn’t blow as it did yesterday. 
His disciples are grief-stricken. Christ lies in the grave, and you and I sit by in mourning. His cold, dead Body still bears the scars of intense suffering, mortal wounds on His Body that will remain visible for all eternity, marked with _the price of my sins_. See on that Face the wounds received to erase our sins. See there the marks of the blows received in order to refashion our warped nature in His Image. On that back see the marks of the scourging endured to remove the burden of sin that weighs upon our shoulders. See those hands, nailed firmly to a tree, for us; the holes on those feet that walked the earth bringing repentance.
Let’s accompany Our Lady today. Still in sorrow as she recalls her Son’s Passion, Our Mother watches with a serene face, in hope. With her we will hold her Son’s body: “_I will press my arms tightly round the cold Body, the corpse of Christ, with the fire of my love...; I will unnail it, with my reparation and mortifications..., I will wrap it in the new winding-sheet of my clean life, and I will bury it in the living rock of my breast, where no one can tear it away from me, and there, Lord, take your rest! Were the whole world to abandon you and to scorn you... serviam!, I will serve you, Lord_” (St Josemaría).
