TITLE: Friday 20th February GOSPEL: Mt 9:14-15 Then the disciples of John came to him, saying, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?" And Jesus said to them, "Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? The days will come, when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast. COMMENTS: There is a time for celebrations and a time for mortification. A wedding is time of celebration. And Lent is time for penance and mortification. Today is the third day of Lent; how is your mortification so far? Is there anything we can improve? Can we be more generous or consistent in sacrifice? Let us be really generous! 
Don’t bargain with Jesus for He did not bargain on the Cross. Besides, mortification will not affect your health, but even make you stronger. Carthusians are a religious family that offer many sacrifices every day, among them, for instance, they do not eat meat any day of the year. They tell the story of Pope Urban V, when he was told that, he wanted to change that austerity thinking that they will have _health_ problems for a poor diet. Health problems!? Ten Carthusians were sent to visit the Pope and explain their sacrifices, the younger of them had already passed 90 years old. One of them, approached the Pope walking without any help or stick and told him: —_I‘m over 100 years old... What do you mean by health?_ That was never changed and Carthusians haven’t changed their diet in their 1000 years of existence.
How generous are you in your sacrifices? Look at Jesus in the Cross; and now think: Am I generous enough?
