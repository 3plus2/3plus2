Friday 20th February

GOSPEL: Mt 9:14-15 Then the disciples of John came to him, saying, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?" And Jesus said to them, "Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? The days will come, when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast. 
COMMENTS: There is a time for celebration – such as a wedding — and a time for mortification – such as Lent. Today is the third day of Lent; how is my mortification so far? Is there anything I can improve in? Can I be more generous or consistent in my sacrifice? _Let’s be really generous!_ 
Jesus didn’t accept the Cross half-heartedly and nor should we. Besides, mortification doesn’t harm your health, if anything it makes you stronger. Carthusian monks offer many sacrifices every day, among them, not eating meat on any day of the year. When Pope Urban V (1310-1370) was told about this harsh diet, he decided it must stop because it would give the monks _health_ problems. Ten Carthusians were sent to visit the Pope and explain their sacrifices; the youngest of them was already over 90 years old. Another approached the Pope walking without any help or stick and told him: —_I‘m over 100 years old... What do you mean by health?_ The Pope then understood, and the monks were allowed to continue with their diet. Carthusians haven’t changed their diet in 1000 years!
How generous am I in my sacrifices? Let’s look at Jesus on the Cross; and think: _Am I generous enough?_
