TITLE: Friday 20th February GOSPEL: Mt 9:14-15 Then the disciples of John came to him, saying, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?" And Jesus said to them, "Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? The days will come, when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast. COMMENTS: There is a time for _celebrations_ and a time for _mortifications_. A wedding is time for the former, and Lent is time for the later. Today is the third day of Lent; how is my mortification so far? Is there anything I can improve? Can I be more generous or consistent in sacrifice? _Let us be really generous!_ 
Let’s not bargain with Jesus for He did not bargain on the Cross. Besides, mortification will not affect your health, but even make you stronger. Carthusians are a religious order that offer many sacrifices every day, among them, for instance, they do not eat meat any day of the year. They tell the story that, when Pope Urban V was told that, he wanted to change that austerity thinking that they will have _health_ problems for a poor diet. Health problems!? Ten Carthusians were sent to visit the Pope and explain their sacrifices, the younger of them had already passed 90 years old. One of them, approached the Pope walking without any help or stick and told him: —_I‘m over 100 years old... What do you mean by health?_ The Pope understood, and it was never changed, so Carthusians haven’t changed their diet in 1000 years.
How generous am I in my sacrifices? Let’s look at Jesus in the Cross; and think: _Am I generous enough?_
