GOSPEL: Mt 5:43-48
"I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? ...  You, therefore, must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect”.
COMMENTS: To hold a grudge is like building a prison, and locking oneself inside, and throwing away the key. We have to ask Jesus to be able to love everyone no matter what they do or think or say. That is to be like our _heavenly Father_: Perfect in Love. St John of the Cross has given us a great piece of advice: “_Where there is no love, put love—and you will find love_.”
_If you love those who love you, what reward have you?_ That is very _easy_! But to love those who despise you, who scorn you, who insult you... That is very ‘_virtuous_’!
There was once a boy who persistently bullied a classmate who was also his next-door neighbour, but the neighbour always took it with a smile and said nothing. Eventually the bully grew impatient and asked him: —_Why do you always smile?!_ —_Because I know that your parents are going through a hard time, and so I pray for your family every time you insult me_. It was the beginning of a lifelong friendship.
Lord, help me to get to know the others as You do, and I will love them as You do, and _be perfect, as my heavenly Father is perfect_.
