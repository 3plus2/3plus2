TITLE: Monday 23rd February 
GOSPEL: Mt 25:31-46 "When the Son of man comes in his glory, ... He will say to those at his right hand, 'Come, O blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; for I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.' 
COMMENTS: Lent is time for charity. And charity is something we should pray about. When you pray about your family members, your friends... you discover things that you can do for them. Otherwise we do nothing and spend our lives missing opportunities to live charity with people that need us. I can imagine You, Lord, smiling when You explained that, having in mind the millions of billions of act of charity that people do for Your sake. 
One day Bl Teresa of Calcutta was recorded for a TV programme doing her tasks, caring for some lepers. Leprosy can be very disgusting in the final stages. But Bl Teresa was washing the leper with the affection of a mother with her baby. The reporter, unable to restrain her repugnance, said aloud: —_I wouldn’t do that for a million dollars!_ To what Bl Teresa answered: —_Neither would I!_ Only for Christ.
I imagine Your look and the expression in Your face when I go to You at the end of my life and You will smile at me and Your lovely voice would say, in front of all the angels and of my Mother: —*You did it to me!*
