TITLE: Friday 27th February 
GOSPEL: Mt 5:20-26 Every one who is angry with his brother shall be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother shall be liable to the council, and whoever says, 'You fool!' shall be liable to the hell of fire. So if you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. 
COMMENTS: Few things wound the heart of a father more than to see his children quarrelling. And few sins wound the Divine Heart of our Father God more than bitterness among His children. The virtue of Charity, which we are trying to grow in during Lent, is always the most important virtue. So much so, that He warns us: “_if ever you come to offer anything to Me_”, as we do in the Holy Mass, or even if you just want to talk to me in prayer, make sure that you are at peace with my other children first. If you aren’t, then _leave your gift there before the altar and go_, for I will not accept your offering until you are _reconciled to your brother_.
Some people think that only Cain, with his hands stained in blood, would be forbidden to pray in front of the altar. But there are so many ways to harm the others! Indifference, scorn, insensitiveness, laughing at the mistakes of the others, indiscretion, rudeness, ungratefulness, sarcasm, irony, gossip, bearing grudges, impatience, and so many other names for selfishness...
My Lord, help me to always be charitable towards everyone, so that, at any time of my life, I will be able to stand before Your altar, with my offering of peace, joy and love.
