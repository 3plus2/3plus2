TITLE: Thursday 19th February 
GOSPEL: Lk 9:22-25 Jesus said to his disciples: "The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised." And he said to all, "If any man would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it; and whoever loses his life for my sake, he will save it. For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses or forfeits himself?"
COMMENTS: It is very plain and clear: there is just one way to follow Jesus: _with the Cross_. To try to follow You, Lord, while avoiding sacrifice would be like a bird trying to fly without wings. We do not like to go to the dentist, but we do like to have clean and healthy teeth. Christians do not like pain or suffering for the sake of suffering in itself. We seek it as a _means_ to improve.
I want to follow You to the bitter end, no matter how bitter it is. And during Lent I have a list of sacrifices that I intend to fulfil so as to be close to You. Jesus, You are on the Cross; and I follow You to the Cross with my mortifications.
But let’s be practical: choose _useful_ mortifications; wake up straightaway; eat more of what you do not like, and less of what you love; do the dishes when it is not your job; smile at that annoying person; avoid complaining; tidy your room, don’t put off tasks that you don’t like and do always first what you like; don’t to answer back, and many others...
