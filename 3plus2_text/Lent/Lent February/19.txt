TITLE: Thursday 19th February 
GOSPEL: Lk 9:22-25 Jesus said to his disciples: "The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised." And he said to all, "If any man would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it; and whoever loses his life for my sake, he will save it. For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses or forfeits himself?
COMMENTS: It is very plain and clear: there is just one way to follow Jesus: with the Cross. To try to follow Christ avoiding sacrifice would be like a bird trying to fly without wings. We do not like to go to the dentist, but we do like to have clean and healthy teeth. Christians do not like pain or suffering for the sake of suffering in itself. We seek it as a means to attain perfection.
We want to follow Jesus to the bitter end, no matter how bitter it is. And during Lent we have a list of sacrifices that we intend to fulfil because it is the only one way to be close to Jesus. Jesus is on the Cross; and you and I follow Him to the Cross with our mortifications.
But be practical: It is not about hitting your head on the wall to feel pain. Choose _useful_ mortifications: wake up straightaway, to eat more of what you do not like, to do the dish-washer when it is not your job, to smile to that annoying person, not to complain...
