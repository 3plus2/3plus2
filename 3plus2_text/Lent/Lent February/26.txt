GOSPEL: Mt 7:7-12
"Ask, and it will be given you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For every one who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. Or what man of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent? If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!
COMMENTS: @Everyone who asks receives@. Everyone means _everyone_. As fathers give their children what they need, @how much more@ _will your Father God_ give you what _you_ need! Have you ever prayed slowly about those words: “_how much more_”?
Your Father God is only interested in giving you the best, and not just ‘something’. St Augustine explains that when our prayers are not heard it is because we ask “@aut mali, aut male, aut mala@” [St Augustine was African but he wrote in Latin]. @Mali@, _because we are bad and are not ready to ask_. @Male@, _because we ask badly, with little faith or without perseverance, or with little humility_. @Mala@, _because we ask for bad things, or they are, for some reason, not suitable for us_”.
God is not a ‘vending machine’ that you _insert_ prayers and get what you fancy. He’s a Father that only gives the best. And so, our best prayer is to ask: _Your Will be done_, for that is the best for me, always.
“_Shame on human laziness, for God’s desire to give is greater than our desire to receive_" (St Augustine).
