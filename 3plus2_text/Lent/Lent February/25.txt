GOSPEL:Lk 11:29-32 
When the crowds were increasing, he began to say, "This generation is an evil generation; it seeks a sign, but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of Jonah. For as Jonah became a sign to the men of Nineveh, so will the Son of man be to this generation ... The men of Nineveh will arise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here. 
COMMENTS: God needed someone to preach in Nineveh, and decided that Jonah was ‘the man for the job’. But you know the story, don’t you? The instructions were simple: _Set out for the great city of Nineveh, and preach against it_. Amazingly, the reaction to this God-given mission to Jonah is to @flee in the opposite direction@ from Nineveh. _God has His plans_, may have thought Jonah: _but I have mine_...
God knows what we can do, so we can be sure that He will never ask you ‘more’ than what you can give... But He will never ask you ‘less’. Nineveh could have been condemned if God had not go after Jonah to ‘convince’ him (in a very persuasive way), that the people of Nineveh needed him. When eventually he complied and did what God had asked for, the result was clear: All the people of Nineveh converted and turned to God.
What would have become of those thousands of people if Jonah had not come back? What will become of your friends if you do not do anything to help them? Jesus, I beg You to come and _fetch me_ if ever I run away from those who need me.
