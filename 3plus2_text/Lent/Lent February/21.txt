TITLE: Saturday 21st February 
St Peter Damian GOSPEL: Lk 5:27-32 Levi made him a great feast in his house; and there was a large company of tax collectors and others sitting at table with them. And the Pharisees and their scribes murmured against his disciples, saying, "Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?" And Jesus answered them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick; I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." 
COMMENTS: Jesus came to seek those who need conversion, and needs your help and mine to reach to them. We need to tell sinners that Jesus has given His Life for all of them. That is why we are apostles. No one can be left behind. And so, one of the reasons we offer more sacrifices during Lent is to pray for those sinners that need conversion. 
In the apparitions of Our Lady of Fatima (in 1917) she asked the three children: @”Pray, pray very much and make a sacrifice for sinners, because many souls are going to hell because no one offers sacrifices for them.”@ The three children started to look for ways to mortify themselves. Lucia found a rope one day and suggested it to be cut into three pieces so each of them could wear it continuously around their waists. Pleasing as it was to God, Our Lady had to ask them not to use the rope at night, for they couldn’t sleep. They also gave their lunches to poor children they met along the way, or would spend all the hours of sun without drinking a single drop of water.
The children aged 10, 9 and 7! That is the spirit.
