TITLE: Wednesday 18th February ASH WEDNESDAY.
GOSPEL: Mt 6:1-6, 16-18Beware of practicing your piety before men in order to be seen by them; for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven. "Thus, ... when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by men. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you. COMMENTS: Lent has three legs: prayer, sacrifice and charity. If one of the legs is missing, Lent cannot stand. We need some resolutions for lent that include these three legs. Sometimes we do not need to add more things to our plan of life, as if the only way to improve our prayer would be to make it longer. Maybe a good resolution is to be more consistent in your prayer, in your sacrifices and in your acts of charity.
St Josemaria said: “_Lent should suggest to us these basic questions: Am I advancing in my faithfulness to Christ, in my desire for holiness, in a generous apostolate in my daily life, in my ordinary work among my colleagues? Each one of us, silently, should answer these questions, and we will see that we need to change again if Christ is to live in us, if Jesus’ image is to be reflected clearly in our behaviour_.”
