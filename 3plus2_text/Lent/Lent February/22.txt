GOSPEL: Mk 1:12-15
The Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness. And he was in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan; and he was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered to him. Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God, and saying, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent, and believe in the gospel."
COMMENTS: It is always a great relief to see You, Lord, going through the same things we all have to go through. You were a perfect man, but you did not ‘cheat’: You suffered all that we suffered and _much more_. You even let yourself suffer temptations, just like us.
For that reason, Jesus, it is a great joy to see You overcoming the enemy. I love to see the enemy defeated. The same happens to a football team. When it is really good, people start to think it is _unbeatable_ and everyone dreads having to play them. Then, one day, the _invincible football team_ is defeated, and from then on, no one thinks they are _invincible_ anymore, for the once dreaded enemy has been beaten; and so, they think... _We can beat it as well!_.
You, Lord, have overcome the devil, and now we know that You can beat him again and again, helping us when we go through temptation. We will never fear him; he should fear us, for we don’t fight on our own, but with You. Remind me, my Jesus, in times of trial, to turn to You for help, and then... then _I_ will be _invincible_ for you are _The Invincible One_.
Do I go to Jesus when I am going through a time of temptations?
