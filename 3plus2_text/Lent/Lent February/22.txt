TITLE: Sunday 22nd February 
GOSPEL: Mk 1:12-15 The Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness. And he was in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan; and he was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered to him. Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God, and saying, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent, and believe in the gospel." 
COMMENTS: It is always a great relieve to see You, Lord, going through the same things we, men, have to go through. You were a perfect man, and did not cheat: You suffered all that we suffered and _much more_. And among the things that we have to go through, we encounter also temptations.
For that reason, Jesus, is a great joy to see You overcoming the enemy. I love to see the enemy defeated. It is like with an _invincible football team_, when it is so good, that people starts to think that it is really _unbeatable_. Until another team defeats that team. From that moment on, every team that plays against the _invincible team_ is aware that the team is no longer invincible, for it has been beaten already; and so, they think... _We can beat it as well!_.
You, Lord, have overcome the devil, and now we know that You can beat him again and again, helping us when we go through temptation. We will never fear him; he should fear us, for we don’t fight on our own, but with You. Remind me, my Jesus, in times of trial, to go to You for help, and then... then I will be _invincible_ for you are _The Invincible_.
Do I go to Jesus when I am going through a time of temptations?
