TITLE: Tuesday 24th February 
GOSPEL: Mt 6:7-15 
"And in praying do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard for their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him. Pray then like this: Our Father who art in heaven...” 
COMMENTS: You told us to say: _Our_ Father, and not simply _Father_; and in the four last petitions we say: "give _us_ ... forgive _us_ ... lead _us_ not ... deliver _us_". For You love it when we are united in prayer, when we pray together and we pray for each other, as a family.
During Lent I can go slowly over the Prayer that You taught us. In her autobiography, St. Therese of Lisieux says “_Sometimes when I am in such a state of spiritual dryness that not a single good thought occurs to me, I say very slowly the ‘Our Father,’ or the ‘Hail Mary,’ and these prayers suffice to take me out of myself, and wonderfully refresh me_.” Well, let’s think about it. How many times do I pray these prayers every day, and how many times do I not know what I am saying? Pray the Lord's Prayer with St. Therese, slowly, to get the most out of it, rather than rattling it off on auto-pilot, as we all do sometimes!
“_Slowly. —Consider what you are saying, who is saying it and to whom. For that hurried talk, without time for reflection, is just noise, the clatter of tin cans. And with Saint Teresa, I will tell you that, however much you work your lips, I do not call it prayer_” (St. Josemaría).
