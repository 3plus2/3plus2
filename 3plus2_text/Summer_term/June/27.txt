TITLE: Saturday 27th June
GOSPEL: Mt 8:5-17
As he entered Capernaum, a centurion came forward to him, beseeching him and saying, "Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home, in terrible distress." And he said to him, "I will come and heal him." But the centurion answered him, "Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof; but only say the word, and my servant will be healed. For I am a man under authority, with soldiers under me; and I say to one, 'Go,' and he goes, and to another, 'Come,' and he comes, and to my slave, 'Do this,' and he does it." ... Jesus said, "Go; be it done for you as you have believed." And the servant was healed at that very moment. 
COMMENTS: We use the words of this man before Holy Communion, do you remember? ‘_Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof_’. We aren’t worthy: that’s a fact! Jesus didn’t say to the man, ‘¬_Oh, come on! Don’t say that!_’ because it was true. We are not worthy to receive Holy Communion, but Jesus doesn’t come to us because we are good, but because He is Good.
We aren’t worthy, but God can change that. He has authority. The words of this man made Jesus marvel, because he had real faith. He was a man of authority himself and was used to being obeyed. When he commanded, they obeyed him. And he knew that Jesus had even more authority: if He commanded the sickness to go away, nature had to obey Him. And he was right.
You, Lord, have the authority to heal every disease, leprosy, blindness, deafness, paralysis... You can also give me the faith of this man, to be able to believe that You can also heal my lack of virtues: my pride, my criticisms, my laziness, my vanity, my stubbornness, my lack of charity, my impurity, my disobedience... 
I’m not worthy to have you under my roof, but You want to come anyway! You love me so much that my unworthiness doesn’t stop You from coming. And once You come into it, this little dwelling of mine becomes Your temple, and You ‘_make me worthy_’.
