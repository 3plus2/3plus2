TITLE: Sunday 7th June (Corpus Christi)
GOSPEL: Mk 14:12-16, 22-26 
And as they were eating, he took bread, and blessed, and broke it, and gave it to them, and said, "Take; this is my body." And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it. And he said to them, "This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many." 
COMMENTS: In 2004 St John Paul II led his last Corpus Christi procession. He could no longer walk. Archbishop Marini and Monsignor Konrad Krajewski helped place the Holy Father on a platform of a specially prepared car. In front of him was the monstrance containing the Blessed Sacrament. Monsignor Krajewski explains: “_We went down the Via Merulana towards the Basilica of Saint Mary Major. At some point, the Pope gave a sign to me to come closer. He said in Polish_: ‘*I want to kneel down*.’ _I was so surprised by this request that I didn’t know what to say. I realized that it was physically impossible. With great delicacy, and trembling voice, I explained that the car shook and that it would be very difficult to kneel. In response, I heard a disapproving sound well-known to me_: ‘*Mmm*’. _A little further, the Pope repeated again_: ‘*I want to kneel down*.’ _I said shyly that it was better to wait a little longer, as we were getting closer to the basilica. And again I heard the familiar_: ‘*Mmm*’. _When we passed the church of the Redemptorists, he said firmly and loudly_: ‘*Here is Christ, Please!*.’” 
Archbishop Marini didn’t understand Polish, but he knew what was going on, because he had known St John Paul II for over 20 years, and knew how much he loved the Eucharist. Both priests looked at each other and without a word they helped the Holy Father to kneel down with great difficulty, and holding the Pope. He knelt at least. “_It only lasted a few seconds_”, continues Monsignor Krajewski, “_but it seemed to me to be a whole century. He had to sit down because the knees were not able to keep the body upright on the kneeler_”.
I wish, Lord, to receive You with the purity, humility and devotion with which Your most holy Mother received You, with the spirit and fervour of the saints.
