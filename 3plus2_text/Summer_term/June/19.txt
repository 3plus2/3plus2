TITLE: Friday 19th June
GOSPEL: Mt 6:19-23
"Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. The eye is the lamp of the body. So, if your eye is sound, your whole body will be full of light; but if your eye is not sound, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!"
COMMENTS: Watch what you watch! Because through the eyes you feed your soul. Someone has compared the human heart to a food processor. It has many functions (steaming, emulsifying, blending, precise heating, mixing, milling, whipping, kneading, chopping, weighing, grinding and stirring). If you put in lemon and ice, you get lemon slush; if you put in good fruits you get good juice; with vegetables you can do creams and soups. But if you put in soil and dirt and wood sticks... that’s inedible, disgusting and unhealthy.
What you watch or read or listen to can be a great danger to your spiritual health. But even worse, as it stays in your memory, it isn’t easy to get rid of it, and it becomes like ammunition for the enemy. Because anytime that he wants to give you a hard time he just needs to remind you of something that you have in your memory, something that you saw or heard or read...
Protect your heart by guarding your sight: “_Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God_”. Those who don’t guard their sight may see many things... but not God. To see God you need to watch what you watch! Sometimes to defend your purity you may need to be heroic. 
Saints have had temptations as well. To get rid of a temptation “_Saint Francis of Assisi rolled in the snow, Saint Benedict threw himself into a thorn bush, Saint Bernard plunged into an icy pond_” (St Josemaría). Ask Our Lady for help to be strong in your fight against temptation. 
Someone once asked Saint Dominic why he kept his eyes lowered to the ground during most the day. The saint answered: “_So that my eyes might be pure when I one day behold the Blessed Mother_.”
