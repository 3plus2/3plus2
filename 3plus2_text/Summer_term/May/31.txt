TITLE: Sunday 31st May (The Most Holy Trinity)
GOSPEL: Mt 28:16-20
Jesus came and said to them, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, to the close of the age."

COMMENTS: The Most Holy Trinity, Father, Son and Holy Spirit: three divine Persons in One God. St John Paul II said that God is a very happy family, and God wants to share the happiness of that family with us. God invites us to belong to it and we enter God’s family when we are baptized. That is why in the Gospel we hear Jesus commanding that all be baptized “_in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit_”. When we were baptized we were adopted as sons and daughters of God. It’s very easy to say: ‘_I’m a child of God_’, but it would be good to stop and think about it.
But no matter how much you think about the Trinity, it will remain a Mystery. One day St. Augustine was walking on the beach considering the mystery of the Trinity. Then he saw a boy in front of him who had dug a hole in the sand and was bringing some water in a bucket to pour into the hole, back and forth. St. Augustine asked him, “_What are you doing?_” “_I’m going to pour the entire ocean into this hole_.” “_That is impossible, the whole ocean will not fit in the hole you have made_” said St. Augustine. The boy replied, “_I will finish before you fit the mystery of the Trinity into your tiny little brain_.” The story concludes by saying that the boy vanished because St. Augustine had been talking to an angel.
We belong to God’s family. Let’s turn often to the Father, Son and Holy Spirit in prayer and repeat, as if it were the first time: _Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen_.
