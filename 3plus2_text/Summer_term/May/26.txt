TITLE: Tuesday 26th May (St Phillip Neri)
GOSPEL: Mk 10:28-31
Peter began to say to him, "Lo, we have left everything and followed you." Jesus said, "Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands, for my sake and for the gospel, who will not receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions, and in the age to come eternal life." 
COMMENTS: Jesus asked the young man to leave everything and follow Him. Peter and the others were there, maybe smiling at the idea of that young man joining the group. But the boy went away sad. Then Peter breaks the tense silence trying to comfort Jesus: '_Don't worry, Jesus_' he would say, '_we are with you; we know what is important; see, we have left everything and followed you._' And we can imagine Jesus looking back at His disciples, touched and reassured by their generosity, and His kind voice explaining to them that it is worthwhile: “_there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands, for my sake and for the gospel..._”
Today is the feast of St. Phillip Neri. One day, when he was old, a young man came to see him. The saint was sitting in his chair and the boy was kneeling beside him. The saint listened attentively to the boy’s plans while his hand played with the lad’s hair: ‘_And, after the exam, what then?_’ said the saint. ‘_then I shall try for a degree in law_’. ‘_And then?_’, insisted the saint. ‘_I want to be a barrister: everyone tells me I’m cut out for it_’. ‘_And then?_’ ‘_Well, as a barrister, I could marry and settle down and be a rich man_’. ‘_And then?_’ ‘_Oh, well, I might end up as a judge, and obtain some high office in the court of Rome_’. ‘_And then?_’ ‘_Some day I should retire with a big pension and be able to enjoy an honourable old age_’. ‘_And then?_ ‘_Then? Well father, some day I suppose I should have to die_’. The saint drew the boy’s head closer and whispered in his ear: ‘_And what then?_’ The lad, Francesco Zazzara never forgot that conversation, and later threw away all his worldly ambitions and joined St Phillip Neri’s Congregation of the Oratory.
