TITLE: 1st December (Novena to the Immaculate Conception)
GOSPEL: Mt 8:5–11 When Jesus entered Capernaum, a centurion approached him and appealed to him, saying, Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed, suffering dreadfully. He said to him, “I will come and cure him. The centurion said in reply, Lord, I am not worthy to have you enter under my roof; only say the word and my servant will be healed.
COMMENTS:
This man is giving us two lessons: The first one is humility. Do you see how he considers himself unworthy? He does not deserve the miracle, not to have Jesus at home, nor even to address to him without introduction... But he is asking nothing for himself. He asks for his servant. He does not hesitate to intercede on behalf of his servant. Jesus, make me learn the lesson!
The second lesson in on faith: He _knows_ that if Jesus says the word... it just happens! If my faith were the size of a mustard seed, then, you Lord would say a word and transform me: you would make me a soul of prayer, you could make me a courageous apostle; you could give me humility, and fortitude, and holy Purity, and charity, and hope, and faith! With just one word... Please, Lord, say it!
*Do I have that faith?*
