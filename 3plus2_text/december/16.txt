TITLE: 16th December
COMMENTS: Mt 21:28–32 
Jesus said to the chief priests and the elders of the people: “A man had two sons. He came to the first and said, ‘Son, go out and work in the vineyard today.’ The son said in reply, ‘I will not,’ but afterwards he changed his mind and went. The man came to the other son and gave the same order. He said in reply, ‘Yes, sir,’ but did not go. Which of the two did his father’s will?” They answered, “The first.” 
COMMENTS: Like in the Gospel yesterday: there are people who pray but do not listen to You. When You call blessed those who hear the Voice of God, You always add: and obey it (Lk 1:38, 11:28). They are blessed because they know God personally and are glad to hear and obey His Word. St James made the point in his letter: Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says (Jas 1:22).
Do I hunger for God and for His Word? Lord, increase my hunger for your word. May I always prefer Your Will over my will and seek to please You in all things. 
It only takes a second. Before setting about anything, ask yourself: What does God want of me in this? Then, with divine grace... do it! (St Josemaría)
Do I realize what “Your will be done” means when I say it everyday?
