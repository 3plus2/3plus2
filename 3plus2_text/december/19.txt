TITLE: 19th December
GOSPEL: Lk 1:5–25 
The angel said to Zechariah, “Do not be afraid, Zechariah, because your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall name him John” [...] Then Zechariah said to the angel, “How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years.” 
COMMENTS: Zechariah was a godly man who was tuned to God’s voice. Both Zechariah and Elizabeth were “upright in the sight of God, observing all the Lord’s commandments and regulations blamelessly.” God’s angelic messenger greeted Zechariah with a blessing beyond his expectations. “Your prayer is heard!” Of course it has been... God always listens to our prayers.
You, Lord long for my prayer. You thirst for my dialog. No one ever has sought to speak to men as much as you have... and no one ever had paid higher price that the price you paid. I firmly believe that you are here, that you hear me!
Do I?
