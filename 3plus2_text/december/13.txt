TITLE: 13th December
GOSPEL: Mt 17:9a, 10–13
As they were coming down from the mountain, the disciples asked Jesus, “Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?” He said in reply, “Elijah will indeed come and restore all things; but I tell you that Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him but did to him whatever they pleased. So also will the Son of Man suffer at their hands.” Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them of John the Baptist.
COMMENTS: I am always stricken by the lack of sight of some people. They can have a prophet right in front of their faces and fail to recognize him. On one occasion Elijah gently brings a dead boy back to life for the sake of the widowed mother (1 Kgs 17:22), St John the Baptist was followed by thousands. 
The Israelites were awaiting Jesus from centuries. And when He came... they also failed to recognize Him. That is advent for: that I may be ready to see Him coming and to recognize Him: Advent is here. What a marvellous time in which to renew your desire, your nostalgia, your real longing for Christ to come — for him to come every day to your soul in the Eucharist. The Church encourages us: Ecce veniet! — He is about to arrive! (St Josemaría). How are you going to make yourself ready?
