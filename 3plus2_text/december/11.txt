TITLE: 11th December
GOSPEL: Mt 11:11–15
Jesus said to the crowds: “From the days of John the Baptist until now, the Kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent are taking it by force. All the prophets and the law prophesied up to the time of John. And if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah, the one who is to come. Whoever has ears ought to hear.”

COMMENTS: I see it clear, Lord: without fight there is no Heaven. To follow you, at times...  is so hard! Of course it is. Climb to heaven is like climb a high peak.
When the climb up becomes extremely difficult, we are tempted to give up or at least to make a stop which would make it impossible to reach the summit on time. But, like other times, we will overcome the difficulties and will continue walking.
Make up my mind and tell Him: I will fight until the end to love You more each day, to reach the summit of Heaven, “come what may, happen what may, whatever work is involved, whatever criticism arises, whether they arrive or whether they die on the road, or even if they don’t have courage for the trials that are met, or if the whole world collapses.” (St Teresa). Is my resolution as firm as that?
