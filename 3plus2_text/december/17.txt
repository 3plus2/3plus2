TITLE: 17th December
GOSPEL: Mt 1:1–17 
The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. 
The total number of generations from Abraham to David is fourteen generations; from David to the Babylonian exile, fourteen generations; from the Babylonian exile to the Christ, fourteen generations.
COMMENTS: Today the Gospel comes full of names of Jesus’ ancestors. Some of them well-known patriarchs and saints, but some others well-known sinners. The story before Jesus was one of a mixture of saints and sinners, so also is the story since Jesus, e.g. Peter who denied Jesus and Paul who persecuted Christians. You, Lord can do good counting on bad people and work with whom You can. 
The last third of the genealogy contains people who are unknown, a sign to us that we too like them can continue the story of Jesus even if unknown.
Am I faithful instrument in His Hands? Do I allow Him to work wonders and transform the world through me?
