TITLE: 20th December
GOSPEL: Lk 1:26–38 
The angel said to Mary, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore the child to be born will be called holy, the Son of God.” Mary said, “Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord. May it be done to me according to your word.” Then the angel departed from her.
COMMENTS: Fiat! Be done! Everything that our Lady is told by the angel is very mysterious. She may not have understood great part of it, but she stills knows that God does not make mistakes, and that whatever He asks for is the best, always. Every day, when I pray “your will be done” I am actually asking for help to do your will, for I know that is the best for me. 
Do I really want to do what God wants me to do? Or do I still think that my plan is better? The example of Mary is the same as Jesus in Golgotha: Not my will, but your Will be done!
