TITLE: 18th December
GOSPEL: Mt 1:18–25
The angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary your wife into your home. For it is through the Holy Spirit that this child has been conceived in her. She will bear a son and you are to name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.” [...] When Joseph awoke, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took his wife into his home. 
COMMENTS: How good Joseph is! He did as the Lord commanded: Your Will be done! I have to learn from him: So humble, so chaste, so docile, so good. On the Holy Patriarch felt the mission to guard the Son of God, King of the world, the mission to guard the virginity and holiness of Mary, the duty of cooperating (he was the only called to share the knowledge of the great mystery hidden for ages) in the divine incarnation and salvation of mankind (Bl Pius IX).
We have to have a holy envy of St Joseph, and say him that we want to live like him very close to Jesus, to learn so many things as he learn from Jesus; to teach us to treat the Lord and our Lady (Bl Álvaro)
