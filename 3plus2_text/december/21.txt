TITLE: 21st December
GOSPEL: Lk 1:39–45 
Mary set out in those days and travelled to the hill country in haste to a town of Judah, where she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the infant leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth, filled with the Holy Spirit, cried out in a loud voice and said, “Most blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb.”
COMMENTS: You see: no one has asked Mary to go to help there. She knew that Elisabeth was pregnant, and old, and went “in haste”. In Cana... no one came to Mary to tell her that they were running out of wine. A soul that has his eyes in the others has no need to be asked for, for they are ready to help before anyone knows they need help. 
Am I able to find the needs of the others before they ask for help? Do I wait until I am asked to do something for them?
Turn your eyes towards the Blessed Virgin and see how she practises the virtue of loyalty. When Elizabeth needs her, the Gospel says that she went cum festinatione, — joyfully making haste. Learn from her! (St Josemaría)
