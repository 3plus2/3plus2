TITLE: 9th December
GOSPEL: Mt 18:12–14 
Jesus said to his disciples: “If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine in the hills and go in search of the stray? And if he finds it, amen, I say to you, he rejoices more over it than over the ninety-nine that did not stray. In just the same way, it is not the will of your heavenly Father that one of these little ones be lost.”

COMMENTS:
You, Lord, are the Good Shepherd and do not give up on anyone. You draw on all Your means—and they are many—so that no one will be left behind forever. This fills me with hope. You will not leave me; You will do everything on Your part to guide me to Heaven, and You will do the same for those who are dear to me..., who are slightly lame. You will help them reach their eternal destiny. You want everyone with You.
“My God, how easy it is to persevere when we know that You are the Good Shepherd, and that we—you and I—are sheep belonging to your flock! For we know full well that the Good Shepherd gives his whole life for each one of his sheep” (St Josemaría). For me. For you.
You leave no one behind. Thank you, Lord. 
[I can now pray about my apostolate and my friends, also sheep of His flock]
