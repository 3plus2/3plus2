TITLE: 6th December (7th day of the Novena)
GOSPEL: Mt 9:35–10:1, 5a, 6–8
Jesus went around to all the towns and villages, teaching [...]. At the sight of the crowds, his heart was moved with pity for them because they were troubled and abandoned, like sheep without a shepherd. Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is abundant but the labourers are few; so ask the master of the harvest to send out labourers for his harvest.”
COMMENTS: I understand your pity, Jesus, and your complaint, that there are few that want to work for You. You can’t count on many for they do not want to give themselves to the full. Can you Lord, count on me? 
If a man fills a large earthenware jar with wine, and leaves some other jars half full, when he returns to look at his wine jars, he does not examine the one he filled: he knows that the wine will be well preserved. Instead, he observes those that are half-full, because he fears that they may have turned sour. The same thing happens with the soul. Giving oneself partially ends up corrupting our friendship with Jesus. Only complete generosity can allow us to follow in His footsteps. Do I give myself to the full?
