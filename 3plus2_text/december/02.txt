TITLE: 2nd December (3rd day of the Novena)
GOSPEL: Lk 10:21–24
Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said, “I give you praise, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for although you have hidden these things from the wise and the learned you have revealed them to the childlike.
COMMENTS: No wonder that Jesus loves children: Children are vulnerable, open, trusting, reliant, weak, and must depend on others. A child is an open vessel ready to receive. And when you open it, you give him the opportunity to fill it. St Josemaría writes in Holy Rosary: My friend, if you want to be great, become little. To be little it is necessary to believe as children believe, to love as children love, to give yourself up as children give themselves up... to pray as children pray.
The most important thing that children do not forget is that the can do nothing by themselves: To become children we must renounce our pride and self-sufficiency, recognizing that we can do nothing by ourselves. 
Jesus, help me to become a child who knows how to love you. Am I like a child that does not give up, nor gets discouraged, nor stops trying until he gets what he is asking for? Am I asking for a prayerful soul, full of love for God?
