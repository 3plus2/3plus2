TITLE: 12th December: Our Lady of Guadalupe
GOSPEL: Lk 1:39–47
Mary set out and travelled to the hill country in haste to a town of Judah, where she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the infant leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth, filled with the Holy Spirit, cried out in a loud voice and said, “Most blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb. And how does this happen to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?” 
COMMENTS: On December 12th, 1531, Juan Diego, an Indian convert was going to the Church at Tlatelolco in order to bring a priest to his dying uncle. He was stopped by the Lady, who had come down from Tepeyac Hill to meet him in the road. She listened quietly to Juan's excuse for not having kept his appointment with her the day before. When he had finished speaking she said, "It is well, littlest and dearest of my sons, but now listen to me. Do not let anything afflict you and be not afraid of illness or pain. Am I not here who am your Mother? Are you not under my shadow and protection? Are you not in the crossing of my arms? Is there anything else you need?"
How do you talk to your mother? And... to your Mother? When you talk to her: Do you consider that? How is your devotion to her?
