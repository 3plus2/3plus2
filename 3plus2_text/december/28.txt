TITLE: 28th December: Holy Family
GOSPEL: Lk 2:22, 39â€“40
When the days were completed for their purification according to the law of Moses, they took him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord. When they had fulfilled all the prescriptions of the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth. The child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom; and the favour of God was upon him.

COMMENTS: Here you have a synopsis of three decades of life of Jesus Christ. When we think about the plan of salvation that God established, we find it difficult to understand that, to redeem men, He thought that 33 years could do. 30 years of family and work life, 3 years going around Judea and Galilee preaching and healing, 3 hours hanging on the Cross, and after 3 days: Resurrection. I do not think that many angels could agree, or even understand the plan of Redemption? 
But it is crystal clear: If we cannot sanctify our ordinary work and family life, then there is nothing that we can sanctify.
Do your parents and siblings think that you are sanctifying yourself?
