TITLE: Friday 13th February
GOSPEL: Mk 7:31–37 And they brought to him a man who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech; and they besought him to lay his hand upon him. And taking him aside from the multitude privately, he put his fingers into his ears, and he spat and touched his tongue; and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, "Ephphatha," that is, "Be opened." And his ears were opened, his tongue was released, and he spoke plainly ... And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, "He has done all things well; he even makes the deaf hear and the dumb speak." COMMENTS: This man could not speak; he was unable to explain his problems or to be helped, for he could not listen to anyone either. Some people have this problem as well. God has given us people who can help us: Priests, parents, friends, leaders... They can listen to our concerns, anxieties, joys, doubts... and they can give us advice, help, support. All the saints have had someone to speak to. They are called spiritual guides or directors; and they are provided by God to help His children to go to Heaven. 
This man had the problem of not being able to speak or to listen. He could not be helped. We need to ask Jesus to open our mouth, to be sincere, able to say what I have inside, and the help to listen to the advice and support that I receive. "_Ephphatha_" Jesus: open my mouth and ears!
Do I have a spiritual guide? Am I sincere and tell things as they are, ready to receive all the advice I need with humility?
