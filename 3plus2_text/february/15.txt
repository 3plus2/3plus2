TITLE: Sunday 15th February
GOSPEL: Mk 1:40–45And a leper came to him beseeching him, and kneeling said to him, "If you will, you can make me clean." Moved with pity, he stretched out his hand and touched him, and said to him, "I will; be clean." And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean. 
COMMENTS: Jesus was moved with pity wherever He met someone in need, and touching the sick He healed them with His hand. During World War II when the Nazis were bombing London, there was a Church that had a statue of Jesus on their lawn with his arms outstretched. As the bombs fell, the Church was destroyed and the statue was blown up. When they started to rebuild the church they discovered the arms and hands were so pulverized they could not be salvaged. Today, the statue of Jesus Christ stands with no arms, and with a text that reads, “_Christ has no hands but yours. And Christ has no arms but yours_.” You and I have to reach to people on Jesus behalf:
«_Christ has no body but yours, No hands, no feet on earth but yours, Yours are the eyes with which he looks with Compassion on this world, Yours are the feet with which he walks to do good, Yours are the hands, with which he blesses all the world. Yours are the hands, yours are the feet, Yours are the eyes, you are his body. Christ has no body now but yours, No hands, no feet on earth but yours, Yours are the eyes with which he looks with compassion on this world. Christ has no body now on earth but yours_» (St Teresa)
