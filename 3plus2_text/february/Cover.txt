This little booklet is designed to help you improve your friendship with Jesus Christ by using His Gospel, which is the best book for prayer. By following Him, His life, His words, His actions, you will fall in love with Him. 
You learn to walk by walking, to speak by speaking, and to pray... by praying. Have a daily time to chat with God and you will be closer to Him each day. He wants you to be his intimate friend. He wants you to become a saint. If you have this personal relationship with Him through prayer, then you will also be able to bring other people closer to Him, and they in turn will discover the joy of friendship with Jesus and the call to holiness. 
“_How to pray? This is a simple matter. I would say: Pray any way you like, so long as you do pray_.” (St John Paul II)
