TITLE: Wednesday 11th February. Our Lady of Lourdes
GOSPEL: Mk 7:14–23 And he called the people to him again, and said to them, "Hear me, all of you, and understand: there is nothing outside a man which by going into him can defile him; but the things which come out of a man are what defile him." 
COMMENTS: “_For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, theft, murder, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, envy, slander, pride, foolishness_”... But also from within, out of the heart come the acts of love, of thankfulness and adoration. We need to ask for that purity of heart that will make it possible for us to “_see God_” (_Mt_ 5:8). To achieve that purity we count also on the help of “_the Immaculate Conception_” as she called herself when she appeared to St Bernadette at Lourdes in 1858. She has the power to overcome the enemy and his temptations. Let us ask Mary for the virtue of Holy Purity. 
Never speak about impure things. It is _sticky_, you know! I was told the story of a young boy who was struggling to live holy purity, but some of his friends would try time and again to speak about girls in an improper manner. He would always change the topic. He asked then: _Did you watch the football match this weekend?_ If they said yes, he would ask them to explain it; if they said no, he would explain it to them. One day, one of them, a bit tired of the change of conversation, ask him: _Why do you always speak about football when we want to speak about girls?_ and he answered: _Did you see the football match this weekend?_
