TITLE: Tuesday 3rd February 
GOSPEL: Mk 5:21–43 
Then came one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and fell at his feet, and besought him, saying, "My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands on her, so that she may be made well, and live." ... When they came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, he saw a tumult, and people weeping and wailing loudly. And when he had entered, he said to them, "Why do you make a tumult and weep? The child is not dead but sleeping." And they laughed at him. But he put them all outside ... and taking her by the hand he said to her, "Talitha cumi"; which means, "Little girl, I say to you, arise." And immediately the girl got up and walked (she was twelve years of age), and they were immediately overcome with amazement.
COMMENTS: That father really loved his daughter. He was able to go where Jesus was, to fall at his feet (even if he was himself one of the rulers) and implore for her. Jesus loves it when we come to implore for other people; when we do not ask anything for ourselves. Do you pray usually for the others?
“_And they laughed at him_” says the Gospel. They do not believe that Jesus has power to raise people from the dead. But you and I do believe, and for that reason we come to Him to pray. Do you have the faith of that father, and this same love to intercede for the others?
