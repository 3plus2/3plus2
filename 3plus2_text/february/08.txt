TITLE: Sunday 8th February
GOSPEL: Mk 1:29–39 That evening, at sundown, they brought to him all who were sick or possessed with demons. And the whole city was gathered together about the door. And he healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him. And in the morning, a great while before day, he rose and went out to a lonely place, and there he prayed. And Simon and those who were with him pursued him, and they found him and said to him, "Every one is searching for you." And he said to them, "Let us go on to the next towns, that I may preach there also; for that is why I came out." COMMENTS: “_Everyone is searching for you_”; everyone is searching for Jesus; everyone has some illness to be healed, some advice to ask, some problems to tell Him. “_For You have formed us for Yourself, and our hearts are restless till they find rest in You_.” [St. Augustine]. 
The Catechism explains that the “_desire for God is written in the human heart, because man is created by God and for God; and God never ceases to draw man to himself. Only in God will he find the truth and happiness he never stops searching for_” [CCC, 27].
Oh, my Jesus! “_everyone is searching for you_”, and You count on me to help them find You, with my clean life, my bold apostolate, my good example. If they see that I follow You, they may come with me in search of You.
