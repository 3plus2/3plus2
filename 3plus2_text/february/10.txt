TITLE: Tuesday 10th February. St Scholastica
GOSPEL: Mk 7:1–13 
The Pharisees and the scribes asked him, "Why do your disciples not live according to the tradition of the elders, but eat with hands defiled?" And he said to them, "Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, 'This people honours me with their lips, but their heart is far from me; in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.'

Some people think that to go to Heaven you _just_ need to do things: to _say prayers_, to _go to Mass_, to _avoid meat on Fridays_, or to _give coins to the poor_… as if you could _buy_ Heaven with some things. But the real command is to love God above all things and our neighbour as ourselves. Do you remember: _not everyone who says Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of Heaven_? Do I love? Am I ready to change my plans when people need me, or do I think that just because I say _my prayers_ I am good (as the Pharisees thought)?
