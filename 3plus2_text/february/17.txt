TITLE: Tuesday 17th February
GOSPEL: Mk 8:14–21 
Now they had forgotten to bring bread; and they had only one loaf with them in the boat. And he cautioned them, saying, "Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod." And they discussed it with one another, saying, "We have no bread." And being aware of it, Jesus said to them, "Why do you discuss the fact that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? 
COMMENTS: it is striking to see how the apostles, after all the time they had spent with Jesus, were unable to understand Him so many times. They were not in tune. Sometimes, when they did not understand something, they would ask Jesus for an explanation. When Jesus told the _parable of the sower_, or that of _the weed_ they asked for the meaning of it: "_Explain to us the parable_” (_Mt_ 13:36). 
Jesus talks about mysteries and that is why we should try to be in tune, asking the Holy Spirit to help us get to know Him better, to read His life. Our Lady and St Joseph also had problems understanding the meaning of His words, do you remember?: “_But they did not understand what he was saying to them_” (_Lc_ 2:50). Then they meditated on His words and had no problem trusting Him. But the apostles, instead of asking Him to explain the meaning, started to debate among themselves...
Do you ask Jesus to explain to you His words? Jesus help me to understand Your words. May the Holy Spirit give me light to read the Gospel and understand... Then I will be able to explain it to others.
