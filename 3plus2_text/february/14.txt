TITLE: Saturday 14th February. St Cyril and Methodius
GOSPEL: Lk 10:1-9 After this the Lord appointed seventy others, and sent them on ahead of him, two by two, into every town and place where he himself was about to come. And he said to them, "The harvest is plentiful, but the labourers are few; pray therefore the Lord of the harvest to send out labourers into his harvest. 
COMMENTS: There are two ideas: 1. there is a lot of work; and 2. there are few labourers working. Jesus needs apostles; that is clear. There is a great harvest, a multitude of people that need to listen to the Gospel. But there are not many ready to help Jesus spread His Gospel to the whole world. Let us pray that many generous souls may offer their lives to God for this mission. 
A man fishing at a reservoir near Baltimore was convinced he had snagged a big fish after his line hooked something substantial. After reeling in his haul, the angler had no fish. He had, however, caught something even more remarkable: a large Gothic monstrance! Unsure what the ornate object was, the man took the monstrance to a local Catholic church, where the priest raised money to restore it. During a joyous Mass that attracted hundreds of people, Archbishop William Lori placed a consecrated Host in it and carried it in a solemn procession. “_Using a monstrance fished out of a lake, we will ask the Lord to send us new ‘fishers of men,'_” Archbishop Lori said in his homily.
Do I pray for vocations? Do I consider that God may have also a plan for me?
