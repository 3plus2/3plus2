TITLE: Monday 2nd February. The Presentation of the Lord
GOSPEL: Lk 2:22–40
Now there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ. ... he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said, "Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word; for mine eyes have seen thy salvation which thou hast prepared in the presence of all peoples, a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and for glory to thy people Israel."
COMMENTS: A promise was made by the Holy Spirit and therefore fulfilled. He followed the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, and got the gift. He had been promised to see the Messiah and he saw Him. A long life was crowned with that encounter. You can imagine the old Simeon, after so many years dreaming about that moment, asking Mary to hold the child in his arms. Joseph was a bit wary at the sight of that old weak man. But the man full of faith and love insisted. "_Now I can die_" he said, for he had seen and held Jesus once! And we can hold him every day in Holy Communion. Simeon waited for many years; we don't have to. He spent years preparing himself for that encounter, enjoyed it fully and gave thanks for it with appreciation beyond limits.
What about you? Do you go to Communion with that desire, preparation, love, and gratitude?
