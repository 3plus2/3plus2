TITLE: Saturday 7th February
GOSPEL: Mk 6:30–34 
The apostles returned to Jesus, and told him all that they had done and taught. And he said to them, "Come away by yourselves to a lonely place, and rest a while." For many were coming and going, and they had no leisure even to eat. And they went away in the boat to a lonely place by themselves.
COMMENTS: Jesus invites His disciples to retire for a while with Him. The activity was intense; people were following them everywhere to meet Jesus wherever He went. But the Apostles need to spend time alone with God. And that is prayer time. They must have enjoyed those moments with the Lord, telling Him countless short stories: what happened when they entered that town, what a woman told them after hearing His teachings, the questions they asked them in that other place, the misunderstandings .... 
Jesus already knew all that, but He must have enjoyed those stories and the emotion that the Apostles showed as they told Him about themselves! The Apostles were also very happy to be with the Master once again. Jesus enjoyed their dialogue, and He also thirsts for yours. He expects us to miss Him, to go and see Him and tell Him, trustingly, the tiny story of our life, with its most insignificant incidents. 
We should feel so safe knowing that He is “at hand,” always available! How can we not go to see Him every day? How can we not greet Him with joy every time we enter a church and look for Him in the tabernacle? How can we not make amends for so many others who forget Him?
