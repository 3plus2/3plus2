TITLE: Sunday 1st February
GOSPEL: Mk 1:21–28 He entered the synagogue and taught. And they were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes. ... And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, "What is this? A new teaching! With authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him."
COMMENTS: People were astonished because He did not talk like other rabbis. He spoke with authority. The difference between Jesus and the others was that Jesus was practicing what He preached. That is the best sermon ever: to be a living example. Following the example of Jesus Christ, thousands of Christians have given their lives so as to remain true to their beliefs. 
In a communist country there was a camp for children from different families. The leaders intone a song to be sung by everyone. “_We do not fear death, / we do not fear your God_.” A witness wrote many years afterwards: _Suddenly one of the girls stands up, remains quiet and does not sing with the rest of us. “Why don’t you sing with us?_” they asked her at the end of the song. With tears in her eyes, she answers: “_I do not sing against God.” A gloomy silence comes over us. No one spoke of that night during the next few days. But on that night, I understood that something important had happened that expanded my horizon because I saw that there are people who have the courage to stand up and say no_”.
Do you give a coherent example among your friends? Do you practice what you preach?
