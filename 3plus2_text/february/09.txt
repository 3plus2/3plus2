TITLE: Monday 9th February
GOSPEL: Mk 6:53–56 And when they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret, and moored to the shore. And when they got out of the boat, immediately the people recognized him, and ran about the whole neighbourhood and began to bring sick people on their pallets to any place where they heard he was. And wherever he came, in villages, cities, or country, they laid the sick in the market places, and besought him that they might touch even the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched it were made well.
COMMENTS:The touch of the fringe of His garments was enough to heal everyone from every disease. We, too, touch Christ. We do not touch the tassel of his cloak. We touch Him in the Eucharist. Saint Josemaría would remember that in Zaragoza in 1920 he once passed a bar and saw a famous bullfighter there. Some children approached the popular celebrity and one of them exclaimed happily: “_I touched him! I touched him!_” The saint was moved by that scene and would constantly evoke it to urge us to stop and reflect about the real and extraordinary event of intimately approaching Jesus every day in the Eucharist.
The Holy Eucharist is the hidden source of indescribable goodness for the soul, which goes far beyond our existence here on earth... A growing friendship with the Lord should move us to desire Communion, to unite ourselves more intimately to Him. We will search for Him with the diligence of those sick people, and we will go through the crowds until we find Him, because He is waiting for us.
