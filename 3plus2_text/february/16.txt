TITLE: Monday 16th FebruaryGOSPEL: Mk 8:11–13The Pharisees came and began to argue with him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, to test him. And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and said, "Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly, I say to you, no sign shall be given to this generation." And he left them, and getting into the boat again he departed to the other side.
COMMENTS: The problem is not that they didn't have a sign; the problem was that they were never satisfied with any sign. They had seen Jesus healing blind, deaf, and dumb people... people with leprosy, all kind of mental and physical diseases... but that was not enough. They even saw Him bringing dead persons back to life. But that was not enough. Each one of them wanted a particular sign, and not just _any sign_.
They could not deny these miracles, and so, they gave them ridiculous explanations: that He was a devil Himself, that the man had never been really blind... When someone doesn't want to believe, no miracle is enough. They would rather find an absurd explanation than have to admit that God has performed a miracle. We pray for them, which is always effective, that God may one day find His way to their hearts and make them understand that their very lives, their existence, their capacity to love is the best sign of the love of God for us. And when you know @how much He loves you@, you see a sign of that @Love@ in everything.
I believe in You, Lord, no matter what You do. I know that everything You do is, simply the best... Do I?
