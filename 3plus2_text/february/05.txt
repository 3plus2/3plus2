TITLE: Thursday 5th February. St Agatha
GOSPEL: Mk 6:7–13And he called to him the twelve, and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits. He charged them to take nothing for their journey except a staff; no bread, no bag, no money in their belts; but to wear sandals and not put on two tunics. And he said to them, "Where you enter a house, stay there until you leave the place. And if any place will not receive you and they refuse to hear you, when you leave, shake off the dust that is on your feet for a testimony against them." So they went out and preached that men should repent. And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many that were sick and healed them.
COMMENTS: He sent them instead of going Himself to all those places. Certainly He (Jesus Christ God-Man) could have gone in Person, and done it better than Peter and the others. It most certainly seems better to receive Jesus in your village than to receive Philip! But He wanted to send His disciples instead, and to entrust to them the spreading of the Word. And if they did not listen to His disciples, they were not listening to Jesus anyway. 
They did not need anything else: _no bread, no bag, no money_. Because it is not about human means but supernatural ones. Just go! Just obey! And once they get to do as they were told it all just happened: _they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many that were sick and healed them_. @Now souls depend on you@.
