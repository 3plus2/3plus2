TITLE: Wednesday 4th February
GOSPEL: Mk 6:1–6On the Sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue; and many who heard him were astonished, saying, "Where did this man get all this? What is the wisdom given to him? What mighty works are wrought by his hands! Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joseph and Judas and Simon, and are not his sisters here with us?" And they took offense at him. And Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honour, except in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house." And he could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands upon a few sick people and healed them. And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went about among the villages teaching.COMMENTS: Does it not strike you to read that _He could do no miracle there_? What does it mean? Is He not _All-mighty_? Yes. Indeed He is; There is no limit to his miracles except one: lack of faith. When you ask for things, do you believe that Jesus Christ can give it to you? He was very clear: _Mk_ 11:24: _Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours_. Or _Mt_ 21:22: _And whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive, if you have faith_. 
Think, for example when you ask in your prayer for your improvement in this or that virtue: when you want to overcome your laziness, your lack of humility, or charity, or sincerity, or whatever it is... How do you ask for it?
