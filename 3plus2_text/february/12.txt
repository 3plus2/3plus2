TITLE: Thursday 12th FebruaryGOSPEL: Mk 7:24–30 A woman, whose little daughter was possessed by an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell down at his feet. Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by birth. And she begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter. And he said to her, "Let the children first be fed, for it is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs." But she answered him, "Yes, Lord; yet even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs." And he said to her, "For this saying you may go your way; the demon has left your daughter." And she went home, and found the child lying in bed, and the demon gone.
COMMENTS: Jesus wants us to insist when we pray. In the Gospel of Matthew of this same scene, he explains that Jesus let this woman insist for a long while before He answered. The same happened with _Bartimaeus_, the blind man, or with lepers, paralytics, fathers of sick children, and even His own Mother, Mary, at Cana. We need to learn to ask with faith, and tenacity.
But we need to know _how_ to ask, for God knows better what we need. Sometimes we ask for things that are not suitable for us, or maybe not for the moment, or we ask with little faith or little humility. We cannot love God just because He gives us things. That would be to confuse God with _a good business_!
How do I ask in my prayers? What do I ask for? Do I always pray for _me_ and _my things_ and _my health_, and _my needs_?
