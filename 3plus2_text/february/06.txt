TITLE: Friday 6th February. St Paul Miki and companions
GOSPEL: Mk 6:14–29
When Herodias' daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests; and the king said to the girl, "Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will grant it." And he vowed to her, "Whatever you ask me, I will give you, even half of my kingdom." And she went out, and said to her mother, "What shall I ask?" And she said, "The head of John the baptizer." And she came in immediately with haste to the king, and asked, saying, "I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter." 
COMMENTS: And so John the Baptist was beheaded for being faithful to the truth. And so many others have given their lives for Christ and watered with their blood the seed of the Gospel. Today is the feast of St Paul Miki and 26 companions, martyrs crucified during the persecution against Catholics in Japan in 1597. When they were in front of the crosses set up for them, St Paul said: _Having arrived at this moment ... I declare to you that there is no other way of salvation than the one followed by Christians. I willingly forgive the king and all those who have desired my death. And I pray that they will obtain the desire of Christian baptism_. 
At this point, he turned toward his companions and began to encourage them in their final struggle. Someone shouted to him that he would soon be in paradise. _Like my Master_, murmured Paul, _I shall die upon the cross. Like him, a lance will pierce my heart so that my blood and my love can flow out upon the land and sanctify it to his name_.
