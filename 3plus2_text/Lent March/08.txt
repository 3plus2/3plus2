TITLE: 8th December: Immaculate Conception 
GOSPEL: Lk 1:26–38
The angel Gabriel said, “Hail, full of grace! The Lord is with you.” But she was greatly troubled at what was said and pondered what sort of greeting this might be. Then the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favour with God. Behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name him Jesus. He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of David his father, and he will rule over the house of Jacob forever, and of his Kingdom there will be no end.”

COMMENTS: As I was one day listening to a really gifted violinist, a little child approached to me and, with pride in his eyes, the smile from ear to ear and full of satisfaction he said to me: —He is my dad! 
And I can imagine yourself today like that boy, as millions of angels and saints and Holy Souls and people contemplate the Immaculate Conception, the supreme masterpiece of Almighty God, the most beloved, the most admired, revered, cherished, esteemed, impressive, extraordinary, magnificent, sublime creature...
Rejoice: —She is your good Mother!
Are you a good child?
