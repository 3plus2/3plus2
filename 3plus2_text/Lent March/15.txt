TITLE: 15th December
GOSPEL: Mt 21:23–27
When he had come into the temple area, the chief priests and the elders of the people approached him as he was teaching and said, “By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave you this authority?” Jesus said to them in reply, “I shall ask you one question, and if you answer it for me, then I shall tell you by what authority I do these things. 
COMMENTS: It is not very frequent to find someone who came to You with a question and went away without an answer, but of course... not everyone was interested. You always give answers to those who are ready to listen. But there is a group of people that do not want to hear what You have to say. They may even come and talk to You, but do not want to listen to You.
Some souls may think that they pray, because they talk to You... but they never listen, lest You say something that can complicate their lives. 
Am I ready to listen to Him? Do I ask Him to talk to me, and to ask me anything, and give me His grace to do it?
«When it's God Who is speaking the proper way to behave is to imitate someone who has an irresistible curiosity and who listens at keyholes. You must listen to everything God says at the keyhole of your heart» (St John Vianney).
