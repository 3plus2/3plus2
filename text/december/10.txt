TITLE: 10th December
GOSPEL: Mt 11:28–30 
Jesus said to the crowds: “Come to me, all you who labour and are burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am meek and humble of heart; and you will find rest for yourselves. For my yoke is easy, and my burden light.”

COMMENTS: 
Some people think of Jesus as a spoilsport: someone who comes when everything is great and weights down on your shoulders a cross, as if saying: —«Fun is over! Let’s pray...». They feel overwhelmed with all the demands: I have to pray, to offer sacrifices, to offer up my work, to live charity with this and that one... So they do not want to do His Will. Do you feel overwhelmed? Then know that your burden does not come from Jesus.
Teach us to rest on You, Jesus; to go to you at all times; to learn from you to be meek and humble. Accepting the will of God wholeheartedly is a sure way of finding joy and peace: happiness in the Cross. Then we realize that Christ's yoke is sweet and that his burden is not heavy (St Josemaría). What are your burdens? Do you ask Him to take them with you?
