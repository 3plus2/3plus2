TITLE: 4th December: (5th day of the Novena)
GOSPEL: Mt 7:21, 24–27
Jesus said to his disciples: “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the Kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven.
Only those who LISTEN and DO. Do you listen to Him in your prayer? “Simon, I have something to tell you...,” Jesus told the Pharisee who had invited Him. And He could say the same thing to you: I have something to tell you. But sometimes, we lack the silence in our hearts, and we are unable to listen: We seem incapable of “tuning in” to Him because there is so much interference.
COMMENTS: A little child complained to his mom when she asked how the school had been that day: —Lessons are boring! Teachers speak all the time and don’t let us say a word!
Well, maybe your prayer is boring as well. You never give God room to speak. Prayer is a dialog: Do I make an effort to listen to Him in my prayer? Do I let him speak?
Once you listen, then you can do what He asks for. Do you do it?
