TITLE: 14th December
GOSPEL: Jn 1:6–8, 19–28 
A man named John was sent from God. He came for testimony, to testify to the light, so that all might believe through him. He was not the light, but came to testify to the light. 
And this is the testimony of John. When the Jews from Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to him to ask him, “Who are you?” [...] He said: “I am the voice of one crying out in the desert”
COMMENTS: St John the Baptist came to testify. He was the messenger, but not the message. Now I am the messenger, the apostle. There is the story that when Jesus was ascending into Heaven, He gazed down and saw a few tiny lights in Jerusalem. During His Ascension, He met the Angel Gabriel, who asked Him: “What are those little lights?”
“They are the apostles that surround my Mother,” Jesus answered him. “This is my plan: once I return to Heaven, I will send them the Holy Spirit so that these small lights can turn into a great bonfire that will ignite the world with charity.” 
The Angel dared to ask: “And if this plan does not work?” After a moment of silence, Jesus answered: “I do not have other plans!”
If I do not my apostolate... no one will. How is your apostolate?
