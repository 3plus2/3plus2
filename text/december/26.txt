TITLE: 26th December: St Stephen, first Martyr.
GOSPEL: Mt 10:17–22 
Jesus said to his disciples: “Beware of men, for they will hand you over to courts and scourge you in their synagogues, and you will be led before governors and kings for my sake as a witness before them and the pagans. When they hand you over, do not worry about how you are to speak or what you are to say. You will be given at that moment what you are to say. For it will not be you who speak but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you. You will be hated by all because of my name, but whoever endures to the end will be saved.”
COMMENTS: St Stephen was the first Christian to be killed for his beliefs. Well, they couldn’t say that Jesus did not warn them. In fact, that is a clear sign that you are in the right path: If you follow Jesus’ footsteps, you get what He got, and you end up where He ended up. The message of Jesus cannot be “digested” by the world. Who could be surprised that people laugh at you, or they despise you for your beliefs, or they even mistreat you.
How do you react when you see that the prophecy of Jesus happens also in your life? Do you pray for those who do not understand you?
