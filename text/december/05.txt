TITLE: 5th December (6th day of the Novena)

GOSPEL: Mt 9:27–31
As Jesus passed by, two blind men followed him, crying out, “Son of David, have pity on us!” [...] Jesus said to them, “Do you believe that I can do this?” “Yes, Lord,” they said to him. Then he touched their eyes and said, “Let it be done for you according to your faith.” And their eyes were opened. 

COMMENTS: It all depended on their faith: since the power of Jesus has no limit, the limit is our faith. If the two blind men had had only a bit of faith maybe they would have passed from blind men to one-eyed men... or short-sighted with myopia... The only limit for miracles is our faith.
When you ask for something to Him, do you do it with faith? A rural church in the middle of farming country had a special Mass to pray for rain. A drought had hit the area hard. In the homily, the priest expressed his amazement: — _This is funny! A hundred people praying for rain and no one brought umbrella!_ 
When the Apostles saw that their faith was not even like a mustard seed, they asked Jesus: _Increase our faith!_ Do you ask for it?
The same who brought sight to the blind can bring to you what you need: _What is it?_
