TITLE: 31st December
GOSPEL: Jn 1:1â€“18 
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came to be through him, and without him nothing came to be. What came to be through him was life, and this life was the light of the human race; the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. 
COMMENTS: He was in the world, and the world came to be through him, but the world did not know him. He came to what was his own, but his own people did not accept him. 
It always strikes me, like a reproach from Heaven: He came to his own, but his own people did not accept him. All of them were waiting for him for centuries and when He came, they did not receive him! They had in their minds they own picture of the Messiah. And Jesus was probably too demanding for them. So they were disappointed with the Messiah that God sent. They had other plans.
Do you also have your own picture of Jesus, as if He had to fit in your plans and not you in His plans? How do you receive Him? What do you do with those who do not receive Him?
