TITLE: 3rd December  Saint Francis Xavier. (4th day of the Novena)
GOSPEL: Mt 15:29–37
Jesus summoned his disciples and said, “My heart is moved with pity for the crowd, for they have been with me now for three days and have nothing to eat. [...] Jesus said to them, “How many loaves do you have?” “Seven,” they replied, “and a few fish.” [...] Then he took the seven loaves and the fish, gave thanks, broke the loaves, and gave them to the disciples, who in turn gave them to the crowds. They all ate and were satisfied. They picked up the fragments left over – seven baskets full....
COMMENTS: Jesus is always caring for souls, you see? And when He wants to do something for them He asks for help. It is usually very little what we can give: 7 loaves? Actually: also a few fish... I love to see the apostles being generous to the full. They want to give everything. They put everything at Jesus’ disposal. Am I generous like them. Do I give all that God asks for?
And then He can multiply everything. But if we give nothing, Jesus can multiply nothing; people get nothing and they starve. 
What does He want? What do I give?
