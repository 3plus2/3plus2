TITLE: 23rd December
GOSPEL: Lk 1:57–66 
When the time arrived for Elizabeth to have her child she gave birth to a son. When they came on the eighth day to circumcise the child, they were going to call him Zechariah after his father, but his mother said in reply, “No. He will be called John.” They made signs, asking his father what he wished him to be called. He asked for a tablet and wrote, “John is his name,” and all were amazed. Immediately his mouth was opened, his tongue freed, and he spoke blessing God. 
COMMENTS: Zechariah was dumb since nine months before. In that time Zechariah had time to meditate upon the goodness and the mercy of the Lord. So, when the moment came to give his son a name, he wrote it on a tablet: "His name is John!" And after he had obeyed, he recovered the use of his voice...
God always fulfils His promises. He promised a child of an elderly couple... and John was born. Do you trust God, that He will fulfil His promises?
When you have to overcome resistance, as Zechariah to name his child... are you firmly resolved to do the will of God?
