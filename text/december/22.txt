TITLE: 22nd December
GOSPEL: Lk 1:46–56 
Mary said: “My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord; my spirit rejoices in God my saviour, for he has looked upon his lowly servant. From this day all generations will call me blessed: the Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is his Name. He has mercy on those who fear him in every generation. He has shown the strength of his arm, and has scattered the proud in their conceit. He has cast down the mighty from their thrones and has lifted up the lowly. He has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent away empty. He has come to the help of his servant Israel for he remembered his promise of mercy, the promise he made to our fathers, to Abraham and his children for ever.” 
COMMENTS: Of course all generation would call her blessed, is she not? She was chosen among millions of women to be the mother of Jesus. So humble! The only creature in the world that could boast considers herself the lowly servant of God. Blessed is she!
And blessed are we for we can be called children of Mary! Keep praying about the humility of Mary, and your lack of humility...
