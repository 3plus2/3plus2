TITLE: 30th December
GOSPEL: Lk 2:36â€“40
When they had fulfilled all the prescriptions of the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth. The child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom; and the favour of God was upon him.
COMMENTS: Jesus fulfils the law because that is what normal and responsible men do. And then, the son of God's came back to his hometown Nazareth. And there he lived with Mary and Joseph, doing apparently nothing special. Redeeming the world without haste in his hidden life. 
The whole life of Jesus is redemption: fetching water, throwing stones in the river, sweeping the workshop at night, chatting with inopportune neighbours, running under the rain, sweating under the sun, whistling local melodies, or caressing his faithful donkey.
Do you see Jesus sanctifying exactly what you have to sanctify? Do you do it?
