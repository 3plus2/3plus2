TITLE: 27th December St John, Apostle and evangelist
GOSPEL: Jn 20:1a and 2–8
On the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene ran and went to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and told them, “They have taken the Lord from the tomb, and we do not know where they put him.” So Peter and the other disciple went out and came to the tomb. They both ran, but the other disciple ran faster than Peter and arrived at the tomb first; [...] Then the other disciple also went in, the one who had arrived at the tomb first, and he saw and believed.
COMMENTS: The beloved one. The young disciple. He was a teenager when met Jesus and since then he never left Him. Nor even when all the others did: in Calvary. It is never too early to follow Jesus with everything. One is never too young to give himself to God. St Louis Gonzaga was 15 when he understood his vocation. St Therese of Lisieux was 14, Blessed Teresa of Calcutta by the age of 12 had made up her mind, St Dominic Savio was 12 when he said to Don Bosco: "If God gives me the call, I very much want to be a priest."
Among the twelve, the young disciple was the beloved one, and one wonders if that young teenager, with a clean heart and a courageous soul was shown that predilection because he loved Jesus with an undivided heart. There is no age for love.
Could you be called the beloved one? Do you look like St John?
